vl AN ESSAY ΟΝ FABULOUS COMPOSITIONS.

the words of Moses, “ All the Host of Heaven was honoured with religious
worship.'‘ The intercourse the Almighty held with the Patriarchs‚ which
was known only by tradition to the Pagan world, gave rise to that medley of γ
gods and men which is found in their works, and on which they have erected
their system ofmythology. Their zeal, which was not to be limited, carried
them yet farther; Nature herself 'was erected into a Deity, and, under dif.
ferent names, had divine honours in different countries. At last, great men
or heroes, who had rendered themselves illustrious by their conquests, were
ranked amongst the Gods, and greatly added to the Pagan creeds.

To this source of Pagan superstition, many others may be added. That
which has been principallyproductive ofagreatvarietyofdeities, wasthefolly
mankind were led into respecting the heroes of their times, whose transactions
they set off with every embellishment offiction, to renderthemmore worthy of
admiration. Hence all the false sublime we meet with in the histories of the
ancient heroes. Resides this, in the first ages of the world, when learning was
but little cultivated, and people had no otherregisters of transactions than the
memories of those who had seen them ς those were afterward conveyed to
posterity with such ornaments as the relater thought necessary to engage
wonder and admiration. What greatly contributed to this source of evil, was
the extravagance of theirorators, who thought they could not sufficientlysooth
the ambition ofthe living, without mixing the marvellous or supernatural, in
their panegyrics of the dead. False informations, and ill-related hearsays,
have intruded a multitude of fictions into the world for realities. A rude and
undigested philosophy, by which the ancients were not able to account for
phaenomenas, led them to a·.tribute life to stare, fountains, and rivers:
ambiguous terms in foreign languages, they interpreted in asense that carried
with it most of the miraculous3 a strong ambition of descending from divine
ancestors, then filled the hcads of mankind with genealogies deduced from
Hercules, Apollo, and Jupiter. The sinister purposes of their Priests increased
the delusion ; as under the sanction of sacred characters, they conccaled
their own debaucheries‚ as well as those of princes and great men, prosti-
tuting their deities to lucrative purposcs. From this source and no other,
has sprung that variety of debaucheries and absurdities that appears in
the accounts given of many of the heathen deities; for of their priests
it was literally true, that they made a traffic of their gods, and ab·
used their altars. This mammon of unrighteousness was the cor-
ner stone and support of the Heathen divinity‚ which grew upon
