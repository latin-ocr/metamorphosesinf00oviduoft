succeeding generations, and was only to be overthrown by the Szm ofRiglc-
teousness, who came with healz‘ng in his wings, to dispel the dark clouds of
superstition, and show the ways of God to the Gentiles. These several
causes just related, have all contributed in their turn to the introduction of
sables into history, and to the involving the first ages of the world in an
impenetrable obscurity. But the poets, yielding too much to the heat ot
their imaginations, have been of all others, the most fertile source of fable ;
and their works, being greatly admired by posterity, gave the finishing hand
to what had already been carried to too great an exceSS. Itis in their work-'s
chiefly that truth is sacrificed to wit, and reality to the offspring of fancy.

ovid never excels so much as when he tpuches on the passions of love,
which he manages in so masterly a manner, as to render it impossible but
the reader must be sensible of the same emotions ι in his free treatment of

have forced another into tears, he became a fountain. If a young creature
lost herself in a wood, she was made a nymph, or adruid. The likeness of
names also gave rise to several fictions3 thus Alopz's was metamorphosed
into a Fox, Cygnus into a swan, Coronis into a Crow, and Cerambis into a
Beetle. So that however insignificant some of these particulars may appear,
for the formation of such unexpected superstructures as have been raised
on them, yet such wasithe strange cast of those early days.

Dramatic and Epic poets have, of all others, been the most forward in
adopting sableS. The first, to make their shows more interesting, have
‚filled the action of their pieces with fiction, and have not scrupled to in-‘
troduce the Gods themselves to unravel their plots; while the latter
abeund in designs no less extravagant.

Hesiod and Homer were indebted to fames for their, principa] ornaments;
