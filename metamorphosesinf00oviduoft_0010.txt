Silenus of Chios, Phylarchus, Theodorus, Berosus, and Apolodorus. Strabo
has a remarkable passage to this purpose. ‘⁴ Nor,’' says he, “were poets
“ alone in the use of sables 3 critics and lawgivers adopt them also

This prediction has so far proved true, that this Pomr has been, ever
since, the source from whence the greatest part of the succeeding ages
have furnished themselves with fancy and allusions,‘and the most celebrat·
ed painters with subjecte and designs3 so that an acquaintance with
ancient fable has become a necessary branch of polite literature, as without
