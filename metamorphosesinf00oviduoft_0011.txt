AN ESSAY ΟΝ FABULOUS COMPOSITIONS· lx

form a judgment of antiques, medals, statues, or paintings; or of even the
works of the modernS, who, in a great measure, frame their designs, or take
their stenes, from one or other of the ancient poets.

The morality that may be drawn from the fables of Ovidis often arbitrary;
while, in other paces, it naturally flows from the subject, As a proof of this,
who does notperceive at first sight, that thestory of Narcissus is an example of
the weakness of self-love ἶ) or that the transformation of the companions of
Ulysses into Swine‚ is meant to figure the dismal consequences of a debauched
and voluptuous life P The protection given to Deucalion and Pyrrha, isthere-

discussions, sor which Mons. Banieris notalittle remarkable, from the number
of picces he has published on this subject, which we have with great freedom
made use of in the course of this undertaking.

At the time that ovid was engaged in his Metamorphosis, human knowledge
had arrived at 'the highest perfection ; for in the Angustan age lived Horace,
Virga, Tibullus, and PropertiuS, with many of the mostenlightened of the phi-
Iosophers‚ who forrefinementoftaste and strength of judgment, have not been
exceeded, buthave ever sifficebeen considered as the standard of excellence; yet
in this period of the perfectioni of the human mind, the religion both of the
Jerusanda Gentiles stood greatlyin need of reformation; the latter, inrespectof
theirreligiousinstitutions, were remarkably deplorable; for whatever advances
