agreater height, or the Deity more disfigured with superfluous rites; yetin
this state of corrupt infidelity‚ the Roman State was in ornear themeridian of
its glory, and its dominion so extensive as to take in, in Europe, Italy, both
the Gaula, Spain, Greece, Illyricum, Dacia, Pannonia, with partof Britain and
Germany ,· in Asia, Asia Minor, Ariaezenia,-Syria‚ Judea, with part of ‘Meso-
potamia and Media ; in Africa, gypt, Numidia, Mauritania, and Lykia, with
a number of islands. At this time all was peace, as Augustus had closed the
Temple of Janus, which had been open for more than two hundred years
Thus far did idolatry triumph, enjoyinga state oftranquilitythat for ages be-
fore hadnot been experienced ; and instead of a right knowledge of the Deity,
our author at this period did not more than convey some lessons ofmorality:
but so blended truth with error, and obscurity with fiction, that he has, as
it were, wrapt in clouds the most important doctrInes; such as the creation
of the world : the fall'of man ; the destruction of the human race by an uni- Ι
versal deiuge ; the change produced in nature by that great event ; the ori-
gin of natural and moral evil, and the final restitution of all things to their
primitive glory and splendour. These, it is true, are most artfully represen-
ted in allegories and lessons of Pagan morality. However, in such venera-
tion was this method of eonveying instruction when properly used, that we
find it is not confined to the profane writers, for the Scriptures, both the
New and the Old, do frequently give the most interesting truths in that
way ε of which, perhaps, the following are not the least remarkable.

Jotlmm's fable ofthe Trees is the oldest that is extant, and as beautiful as
any which have been given since that time. That of the Poor Man and his
Lamb, which Nathan made use of for the instruction of King David, is also
of very early antiquity ; the happy effect of this fable is worth attendIng to,
as it convcyed instruction to the ear ofa king, without offending 3 and was
⁸ so effectual as to bring the man after God’s own hem-t to a sense of his guilt
and his duty. Beside these two, which are preserved in the Scriptures of
the Old Testament, we shall mention another from profane history, of re-
markable importance srom its happy effects'in appeasing a mutiny of the
people in the early days ofrthe Roman Commonwealth, this is the fable of
the Belly and the Members‚ which appeased an incensed rabble, at a time,
when, perhaps, they would have torn to pieccs, any one who should have
preached such doctrine to them in a more direct manner. Fables, doubtless,
must be allowed to have their beginning with the insancy of learning ; yet
they gradually rose into excellence as learning improved, and became as it
were the only medium through which instruction was to be conveyed..
