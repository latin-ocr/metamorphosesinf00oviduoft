AN ESSAY ox metimus composmroxs. xi

Oui· SAvmun, who entered on the office of his love in this aera ofthe Ro-
man grandear, both for knowledge and power, taught his followers in this way,
according to their capacities and dispositions, as he knew well how to be all
things to all men3 therefore we find him very early instructing the people
by a parable (on the lake of Tiberias) in the state of the gospel dispensa
tion, and the nature and different effects of the doctrine of Christianity, by
several similitudes, particularly that of the Husbandman who went out to
sow corn. Many others might be pointed out which might well be thought
unneccessary, as they offer themselves to every reader; more especially, as
we have already sufficiently shown the great use that has been made of
fables, parables, and allegories‚ for conveying the most important truths.

In the course of this ESSAY we have been necessarilyled to consider the
state of the human mind, as well as that ofhuman learning, in both which
are discoverable great improvements3 yet, we find, notwithstanding these
great advances, that the method of conveying religious and moral truths in
a fabulous dress, for which Offid was eminent, was totally insufficient to dis-
pel the cloud of darkness in which mankind were involved, respecting a
right knowledge of the Deity, and osa proper mode of worship ; so we may
conclude, that the progress of science in OridA's age was insufficient indeed
to instruet man in these important matters, and can only be considered as a
useful preparative for the better reception of that purer light, with which
they were soon to be favoured. In this age, thes utmost eflorts of human ·
reason to arrive at perfectiori must have been made, as in it the greatest
ornaments of learning, taste and science shone‚ which in course has been
particularly pointed out ; and which at this day places their professors in
the highest rank of literature : yet, in whatever eminence they stood, they
only served to mark the insufficiency of the human under-standing to bring
men back to the knowledge of the true God by its own natural powers ;
yet it must be allowed tp have been indulged with the fairest opportunity
of exerting its own strength, as it never since has been wrought up to great-
er, or so great a degree of improvement and penetration, elegance and
acuteness, as at that very time. Philosophy and the sciences were then
more generally cultivated, and learning of almost every degree more com· ⁴
mon than in any other age of the world; and therefore this period proved
the critical juncture, the very fulness of time, in which the human race was
to be blessed with the presence of the Son of God ; when all circumstances
were at once ,conspiring to render it the very fittest season for the glorioris
