LIBER I.

THE ARGUMENT.

³² Marmronmosts, in Latin transformatio, from μεΊαΙιωρῷουο-θαι, to change

one thing for another, or tq put on

another shape or appearance. Ovid in

this fabulous History, describes these transformations, both of things and
Ι persons, in a continued series of events from the creation of the world

to his own time.

IN nova fert animus mutatas dicere formas 1
Corpora. Di, coeptis (nam, «Di, mutfistis

et illas) ·

Animus fert dicere formas
mutatas in nova corpora. Di,
adspirate meis coeptis (nam,
Di, mutastis ct ilias) que de-

AdSpirate meis: primfique ab origine mundi< ducite perpetuum carmen ad
Ad mea perpetuum deducite tempora carmen. 4 mea tempora ab prima origine

NOTES.

1. In nova, δια] Itis generally the practice
of poem, at the very beginning of their works,
first to mention what things they intend to
treat of ; aster that, to invoke ; and in the
third place, to relate„ Here Ovid briefly
mentions those things which are to be the sub-
ject of his undertaking3 and then entreats the
assistance of the gods, and, in the last place,
begins his narration from the very beginning
of the world.

'¹ Fert-J Me understood, inclinesme, i. e. 1
have determined.

Mutatas] By an hypallage ι for it means
bodies changed into new forms and shapeS.
And the poet, intending to treat of the trans-
sarmaticus of bodies, begins very elegantly
with a changed structure of words that he
may in some measure shadow out the muta·
tion of things by the type of words.

2. Dt] He invokae the godS, that they

would be pleased so to assist him, that he>

may be able to comprise, in a continued
poem, the mutations that have been from
the beginning of the world down to his
own tune.

Nam Di, ὅπα] “ For, Ο Gods! ye have
changed even them ;” and therefore with
great reason, 1 implore your aid in relating
them. ·

3. Adspirate] Favour: a metaphor taken »
from the winds, which while they fill the
ship's sails, are properly said aspirare. So
virgil ι “ Aspirat primo fortuna labori.”

4. Deducitffi] Hand down, draw out the
length, like a‘thread, all the matter os the
verse. Perpetuum‚ i. e. continued, without
interruptione So Hor. Lib. Ι. Od. 6. “Car-
mine perpetuo celebrare? So that one trans-
formation rnay be aptly connected with an-
other. ‘ .

Tempora] Unto the time of Augustus¹s
empu'e.
