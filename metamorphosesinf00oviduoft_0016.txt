NOTES.

Α Ante] This is the narration with which
the poet begins to describe the first mutation
of things. For in the first placebo says, all
was a chaos, i. e. a certain confusion of all
things, without any form. Afterward‘ he
relates how the chaos (as the ancient philoso-
phers will have it) was changed into AEfner,
air, water, aud earth ι aud so divide& that
the ZEther, on account of its lightness‚ as-
cended to the upper’regions, the air to the
next, the water to tho third ε -and the earth,
from its gravity. descended into the lowest.

Conium] ΨΙηιΐςοενρι· others conjecture,
that Coelum is derived either of ceiando or
*caelandm it seems more agree-„able to me,
that it took its name οξτο του nomeu,
from its concavity.

2. Natum] Nature is that power, by
which au things are supported.

4. Iners ] Sluggish and immovcnble.

reuewed &ty mouth. Phoebus, tiae sun:>

Phoebe, the moon ·; φαῖξος, in Greek, ·
pure.

8 . Circumfusa] Encompassing it. Nor
did the earth, poised by its own weight, hang
in the air, as it now appears.

9. Brachia] So the waters are called the
arms of the ocean, with which it embraces
the earth.

lo. Margine] A margin is the extremity
of a thing3 as though he had said, the ocean
had not yet clasped the extr-emities of the
earth in its embraceS.

Amphitrite] The daughter of Oceanus,
the wige of Neptune. of whom Triton was
born. it is here and in other places put for

'the Sea, so calledwscp‘). τοι) εἰμφιτρίξειν

τὴι γη“ν; because it wears the earth
by washing it.

11. Pontus] For water. Meton.

A'e'n] It is derived, as some will have i‘t,

lifting up.

Instabilis] Ubi stare non detur: there

was no standing on the land.
15. Num] None of the elements had iu

proper figure and nature.
14. obstabatque] Tire elements fought

among diemselyes because there were con ³
trary qualities in the same subject.
