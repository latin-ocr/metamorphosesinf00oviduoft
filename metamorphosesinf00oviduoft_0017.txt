NOTES.

16. Sine pondere. Sto] With light. ‘⁶ Ha,-
bentia pondus pugnabant cum rebus sine
pondere.‘’

Habentia pondus] Heavy things.

17. Natura] God, for it is'here taken
expositively, q. d. Nature, or God, i. e. Na-
ture.

Diremit.] Put an end to. Contentions
and wal-s are properly said dirimi, when
they are determined aud taken away.

19. Liquidum.] Pure, clear.

spissa] From the thick, in which clouds
and rain are generated.

Secrevin] He separated, from secerno.

Coelum.] Is here put for AEther and Ignis,

which is the most pure and clear, and signi-
fies the heavens, and aethereal regions.
‘ 20. Quae, &c.] After God had laid open
the four elements, and brought them out
of that mass they call chaos, although they
were separated as to place, yet he joined
them by a certain concord.

22. Ignea.] AEther and (ire, which. be-
cause of their lightneSS‚ laid claim to the
uppermost place.

Convexi.] A round orbiculat body is so
called, when the outside is convex 3 the in·
side is said torbe concave.

. 525. Legit.] Elegit, chose.

‘24- Proximus] And came next to fire

25. Dounon] Thioker and more heavy.

Elementa] Drev: the great'and beavier·
parts from that mais along with itself. Very
well is traxit used ; for all heavy things are
drawn downwaed by a certain natural.
power. An elemcnt is a simple body, into
which other bodie« are resolved. Some will
have elementum, as if alimentum, from
alend03 because all mixt bodies are nourish-
ed, cherished, and consen-ved by them. An
clement properly so called, is that which is
first in any thlng, and of which the thing
itself is composed3 as letters are the ele-
ments of a word. It is also taken for the
first principles and precepts of any art. So
we call the precepts or rudiments of gram-
mar, elements. So, acc01·ding„to the opi-
nions of ancient philosophers, elements are
taken for these four simple bodies, fire, air,
water, earth ; of the mixture of which, all,⁸
inferior bodies, which are properly said to
be mixed, arise.

26. Pressa, &c.] Kept down. Because
of its gram-ty, it descended into the lowest
place. Made> solid.

Humon] The water.

27. Coei-cuin] Confined the solid orb of
the earth. For it could not be· said tq*
confine it, unless it surrounded it on every

aide.

AN EXPLANATloN oF FABLE 1.

The creation is a mystery above the conception of human reason. The
philosophers, who were never able to comprehend how something could be·
produced out of nothing, established this principle, Ex nihzlo nihil, et in ni·-
lulum nic posse reverti. But observing the beauty and admirable structure of·
the universe, they were under the necessity of attributing it either to a being

superior to nature, or to naturejtselt} they therefore supposed a pre-existent
