matter, which, though at first confused and without form, was afterward
brought into ordei· by some powerful cause. According to theii- opinion, God
was not supposed to be the Creator, but rather the architect to range and dis-
pose of the elements, and to place them in such situations as were most suit-
able to their respective qualities. This confusion of matter is the chaos so¹
often sung by the poets‚ and of which Hesiod gave them the first model.—
It is very perceptible‚ that this system, however monstrous and absurd, is
no other than a disfigured tradition of the Mosaic creation of tlie world.
But though disfigured and obscured by the wild imaginations of the poetS,
and of all that they have sabled-respecting it, we still perceive the force of
some truths, which they could iiot conceal undei- their fictions. For afull
explanation of this sable‚ we need only consult the Bible‚ and read the two

fii-st chapters of the Book of Genesis, where we shall find its mythology
fully unravelled.
