NOTES.

11. Liber-ioris] Because the sea-water is
not confined between nari-ow banks, as that
cf rivers is. ⁷ ,, ⁷

AEquore.] For campus is properly the su-
perficies of the earth. “

Pulsant.] They beat. He very elegantly
distinguishes shores from banks 3 for we use
littora of the sea, and ripae of the rivers.

12. Extendi] The plains to be extended.

Subsidere.] To sink down to the bottom.

Valles] That ob'long concavity (hollow
way) that lies between two neighbouring
nmuntains, is called a valley.

15. Fronde.] Trees to grow in the woods.

Lapidosos] Craggy mountains to rise alost.

14. Duae.] Girdies‚ circlesfoerlmy
is that‘space of the earth that lies between
the two Tropics, or between either of the
Tropics and the nearest polar circle, οι· ei-
ther of the polar cireles and the next polar
point. According to which definition there
are five zones, of which the two outmost
are called frigid, and the middle ones torrid‚
and the two between the ton-id and the
srigid, temperate. Hence Virg. Georg· l.
says thus : '

“ Quinque tenent coelum zonae, quarum
una corusco

'¹‘ Semper sole rubens, et torrida semper ab
igm ε

“ Quam circum exn-emae dextra laevfique ·

trahuntur,

¹¹ Caerulea glacie concretae atque imbribus
atrisg

‘⁴ Has inter mediamque, duae mortalibus
aegns

Munere concessae divi‘im.--'I'hey are al-
so called zonae, because they are certain
broad cii-eles, encompassing heaven and
eenh‘like girdles. The torrid zone is that
which lies between the two tropics of Can-
cer and Capricorn, in breadth 47 degoees,
being divided in the middle by the eqni-

nostia} circle. Itis called llic torri-l. from
the continual heat of the sun which it liet
under ; by reason of which it was accounted
by the ancients to be uninhabitahle. The
northern temperate zone lies between the
tropic of Cancer and the art-tic circle. The
southern temperate zone lies between the
tropic of Capricorn and the antarctic circla
They are called temperate, because they lie
in the middle between cold and heat. The
northern frozen zone lies between the arc-
tic circle and the northern polar point.
from which circle to this point are 23 de-
grees and a-half. The southern srozen zone
lies between the antarctic circle and the
southern polar point. The two outmost are
called frigid3 they are placed very remote
from the beat of the sun ; and, on account
of the intenseness of the cold, were account-
ed uninhabitable.

‚14. Dextra] Which inclines to the north
pole.

Sinistrif} Which inclines to the south pole. '

15. Quinta.] The poet calls the middle
zone the fifth, which he therefore says is
the hotter, as the sun runs through it twice
in a year.

16. Onus] The mass. For the canite ,
which is ponderous, is confined in five zones.
17. Cura Dei] The providence of God.
Plagae] RegionS.

18. [Esau] By servom· and excessive
heat.

19. Locavit] He placed the two tempe-
rate zoues between the two extremes and
middle one.

320. Temperiemque.] They are called
temperate (as is said above.) because they
are placed in the middle between cold and
heat.

22. Onerosior] More pandemus. more-
heavv.
