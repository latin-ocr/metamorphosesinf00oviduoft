24. 'souin-ua] ,A sound which a dry ex-
halation, shut up within a dry and thick
cloud, makes when buxsfing, as with aviolent
blow.

25. Fulminibus] 'lliunder and wind, prou
ducing cold, are begotten in the air. Ful-
men, is a ficiy exnalation breaking out of
a cloud with a great force. The wind is an
exhalation large and cepious, proceeding
out of the earth; which, being repclled and
repressed by resisting cdd, is by little and
little turned asido, and rushes with force
through the air.

27. vix.] 'I'he violence of the wind is
very hardly resisted5 or it is a hard matter
to stand against the force of winds, although
there is a proper place assigned to every
one of them ; so that if they had the liber-
ry of the whole air, all natiue would bne-de·-
sta-oycd.

the four Cardines, τ’ e. principa} points of
the world. the East, Wcst‚ Sonth. and North,
from whence they are called Cardinah -

’ Auroram.] This blows from the Equinoc-
tial east, which, with its-collateral winds, is
moderately warin, dry, and serene, and the
most healthful of all, and renders bodies
lively and soft.

Nabathaeaque.] Eas-tem. For rabath (as ⁷
history says) the son of Ishmael, (as is re-

msnus. “
