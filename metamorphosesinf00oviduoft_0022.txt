Exp. ΕΑΒ. 11. The poets, in relating the manner by which the chaos
has been reduced to order, made use of the natural philosophy of their
time, conceived merelyon the observ-mons of the senses. However, it is
discoverable by certain strokes, that they either consulted tradition or the
scriptur-es: this appears more particularly in the formation of man; who, in
ovid, as in the Book ofGenesis‚ is the last work of the Creator. It is dis-
coverable‚ however disfigured by his fabulous minui-es, to bethe same event.
Prometheus, who is said to temper the earth, and Minerva, to animate his
workmanship2 emblematically represent the great CREA'roR of all things,
who formed man, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life, and
endued him with faculties, which distinguish him from the other creatures
