NOTE S.

l. Aurea) The four ages seem to have
been caused by the various manners of men,
to which names are given according to the
quality of metals. The first was called the
Golden Ageg because, in that time, when Sa-

· turn reigned, men flourished‚ who were of

the best manners. The Second is called the
Silver Age, because at the time when Jupi-
ter began to reign, men began to incline to
vice. The third was the Brazen, which
was employed in wars. The fourth the Iron
Age, because in it men abstained from no
kind of cruelty. =
