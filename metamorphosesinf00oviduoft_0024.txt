19 AEternum.) There were then no va-

stantly blowing ‹h'd so cherish the flowers,
growing *without* culture, that it seemed a
continual spring-time.

zxr. ΕΑΒ. 111. The Golden Age here mentioned by Ovid, is a conti<
Ι nuation of his tradition of the creation‚ and the state of man during his in-
nocence, but so disfigured by fiction, as best to answer the poet’s intentioris,
,and a compliance with his times, as truth then scarce ever appeared in any
other dress, particularly when communicated by such writers. He had learned
that the first man lived for some time in perfect innocence; that the ground
in the garden ofEden furnished hirn, without fillagc, food in abundance, with
every fruit his desires could wish f0r3 that the animals were peaceable,
obediept and submissive to his orders; and, as the Scriptures express it.
-The Lamb and the Lion lay down together. That‚ after his sall, the earth
became unfruitful, and did not yield any thing but with the hardest labour ;
· and that all nature revosted, and no longer aclmowledged man sor his
master, who, sor his disobedience‚ was adjrldged to eat his bre-ad in the
sweat of his brow. The state of innocence is the Golden Age so much
celebrated by our poet3 and his Eden he has placed in Italy, where his
rivers flowed with milk and honey; and what he has said ot' the reign ot=
Saturn and lanus, is a fictitious representation of what the holy Scriptures
‚have recorded os Adam and Noah.
