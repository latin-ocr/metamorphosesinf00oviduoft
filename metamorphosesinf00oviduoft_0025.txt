Next to these days of innocen’ce followed the Silver Age, when men began
to know good from evil, and their nature became corrupt, and conse-
quently less happy than in the Golden age. In the Brazen, which suc-

ceeded‚ men became more wicked;

but the full measure of their wicked.

ness is resen-ved for that of the Iron, when they became truly abominante,
and did all manner of wickedness with greediness.

NOTE S.

1. Postquam.) To the Golden Age, in which
Saturn reigned, the Silver followed, in which
Jupiter reigned : which, as it is worse than
the Golden Age, so it is better than the
Brazen.

Saturno.) After Saturn, the governor of
the Golden Age, was driven out of his king-
dom of Crete, by Jupiter, his son, and was
banished to hell. For saturn, the son of
Vesta, being dispossessed of hfis kingdom by
the Titans‚ was afterward reinstated by his
Son Jupiter, who in the end drove him
out of Crete, when he fied to Janus King
of Italy, by whom being kindly received,
, and taken in as a partner in the kingdom, hc

built a city where Rome now stands, which
he called Saturnia, aster his own name.
