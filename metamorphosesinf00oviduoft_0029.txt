FAB, vl. METAMORPHOSEQN. 15
sufficient to observe that the prince he here treats of, was Titan, whose
empire was shared with his brothers, Neptune and Pluto; and this is what
has given occasion to the division of the world, ,celebrated by the poets.
Jupiter had Phrygia, Crete, and other provinces. B‘Iount Olympus, where
he established himself, was 'regarded as Heaven3 and the effort made to
expel him, as an enterpr1se equally rash and fruitless. Mount Ossa placed
upon Pelion, is a fiction, introduced for the better support of the whole,
and when stripped of its ornaments, is no other than that the. Titans‚ jea-
lous of the power of Jupiter, declared war. They had for their general
Typhoeus or Enceladus, a man resolute and enterprising, who so far pre-
vailed as to force the Gods to retIre into Egypt, where they concealed
themselves under the figures of different animals, a clear indication that
Egypt adored, in process of time, animals, or at least regarded them as
symbols of the Gods.

ΕΑΒ. VI. DEORUM CONCILIUM·

Jupiter, beholding the great wickedness of those men, who sprung from
the blood of the Giants, calls an assembly of the Gods, where he prefers
his complaints against them, when the Gods arc unanimous in the
destruction of the world. '
