ΠΡ. ΓΑ Β. vr. The 'assembly of the Gods, with which Ovid opened
timis Fable, is most magnificent, and upon an occasion the most important,
noi as in the Iliad of Homer, to declare for the Greeks or the Trojans; nonas
in Virgil's AEneffl, to take care of at'ugitive prince, but 'to resolve on the de-
struction of mankind, an event big with the fate of man. But that which
surprises us most in this fable iss, the exact copy Ovid has made of what
is written by Moses in the 6th (thaps of the Bo‘ok of Genesis, where he says,
God repented that he had made man. Moses also relates in the same chapter,
That the wickedness of man was great in the earth, and that every imagination
of their heart was only evil continually. The poet introduces his Jupiter as
saying‚ that formerly he had none but giants to combat with, but now all

mankind were his enemies. In the same chapter, v. 3., . we read that The “

Lot-d said. M,- spirit shall not always strive with man. The poet also adds,
that Jupiter had tried every method to save man, but that their evil was
¹'become incurable. Ovid, in this general corruption, seems not to bc ignorant
that there remained some that were just; for what he attributes to his Deu-
calion, is no other than what the scriptur-es relate of Noah and his family;
and what these writings have mentioned respecting giants before the flood,
the same we siud in Ovid. It is uunecessary to prot-ced any further ὶίι this
