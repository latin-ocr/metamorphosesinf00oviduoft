piot more polite than religious. But, through the inhumanity peculim· to
¹ those ages, he pollutes the feast of Lupercalia, which was instituted bv
him, with the sacrifices of human victims. “
Lycaon built the city of Lycosura, on the mountains of Arcadia, which

is accounted the most ancient of all Greece; and it was upon the altar he
raised here, in honour of Jupiter Lyceus, that he began the inhumari sa-
crifice just mentioned. On this historical transaction‚ has ovid founded his
suble, which is sufficient for so fertile a genius. The cruelty of this prime,
and the name by which he is called, signit'ying in, the Greek a wolf, led
Ovid to the thought of this Metamorphosis, and he changed his prince into
that animal, whose cruel nature gave his genius an opportunity of finely
displaying itself, in describing·the ravages made by him in that appearance.

ΕΑΒ. ’νἿΙΙς DILUVIUM UNIVERSALE·

Jupiter, on account of the general corruption, suspects the punishment ,lie
had inflicted on Lycaon, to be insufficient to restrain the rest ofmankind
from their acts of cruelty‚ and is determined to extirpate them by an
universal deluge. s
