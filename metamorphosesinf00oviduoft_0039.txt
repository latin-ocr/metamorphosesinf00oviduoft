Pausanias has taken notice of five. But that which is most celebrated,
happened in the days of Ogyges, in the reign of Deucalion. Of this 0de
speaks :but as that only overflowed Thessaly, it is evident that the poet froin
his relation, has taken in what tradition taught respecting the universal deiuge,
which all nations seem to have been careful to preserve. (sur author in his
relatIOn represents the whole earth as being overflowed. Τ he sea, accord-
ing to him, joined herwaters to those fallingfrom the Heavens; and Neptune
shook the foundations of the earth to raise new supplies. These are, beyond
all doubt, the catat-acts of llleaven, and the foundations ol? the great deep,
of which Moses writes. ovid, who makes the waters ascend above the high-
est mountains‚ reserves the topos Parnassus, which alludes to Mount Ararat‚
where Noah’s ark rested. In the poet's account, all mankind perished ex-
cept Deucalion and Pyrrha3 this is Noah and his family. Deucalion was a
just and pious man, and the only person preserved for the restoration of man-
kind, which corresponds with the patriarch-al history. The deluge lasted
nine months ; that ot'Ogyges continued as many, When Noah went out οἵ
the ark, he offered sacrifices to God; Deucalion, in gratitude sor his pre-
servation from the waters, according to Pausanias, raised an altar to J opiter
Liberator. Our poet mentions, that there would not be any other deluge
after Deucalion’s; God promises the same thing to Noah. That patriarch,
finding the waters begin to retire, sent out a dove, which returned with
an olive branch ι Plutarch mentions that dove ; and Abydenus speaks osa.
certain hird dispatched out of the ark, that twice returned, not having
found any placeto rest upon. T his parallel might be continued further,
to shew what use Ovid has made of the Mosaic account os the flood,
but what is done is abundantly sufficient.

That the transaction of the flood should be preserved by the tradition pf
all people, is not in the least surprising, as it was an event not easily to he
forgotten; and the changes it has made inthe appearance of the earth,
are a confirmation of it to this day. ,Iosephus mentions the history of the -
general fiood to have been written by Nicholas of Damascus, and others,
who were consulted by the Greeks and Romans. What is further said οῖ
Deucalion, Ι simll reserve for the fable where Ovid mentions the peopling
of the world after the flootl.

Neptune appeases the angry waves, and commands Triton to sound his
shen, that the sea might> retire within its shores, and the rivers within
their banks. Deucalion and Pyrrha are the only persons that are pre-
served from the tieluge. ·
