EXP. PAR. x. In the reign of Deucalion, king of Thessaly, the course
of the river Peneus was stopped; (probably by some earthquake) between
Mount Ossa and Olympus, where it dischargesitselfinto the sea : and, in that
year, there fell so great a quantity of rain, that all Thessaly, which is a lev-el
country, was overfiowed. Deucalion. with his subjects, fied to Parnassus ε
but, as soon as the waters subsided, returned. The children of those who
were preserved, are the mysterious stones of which the poet speaks3 this
fable having no other foundation than the meaning of the word Eben or
Aben ; which equally signifies actone, οι· a child: 01· from the word Laos,
which may be understood for a people or stone. This equivocal term gave
rise to the fable ofthe mystical stonesg which, thrown by Deucalion and.
Pyrrha, formed a new race of meu, who peopled the world after the deluge.

ΕΑΒ. XI. PYTHON SERPENS.

The earth, again invigorated with the heat of the suu, produces a variety -
¹ of monsters; and amongst them the serpent Python, which Apollo kills
with his arrows ; and, the better to commemorate so remarkable an event,
he institutes the Pythian Gamcss and assumes the surname of Pythius:
