ΒΧΓ. Fae. xr. The waters of the great inundation having subsided,
there rcmained a slime, which produced a great variety of insects‚ with the
serpent Python, which did much mischief iri the neighbourhood of Parnas-
sus. Apollo, who armed himself with his bow and arrOWS, slew the serpent3
which, being philosophically explained, imports, that the heat of the sun
having dissipated the exhalations of the earth, those monsters immediately
disappeared. If we have *ἃ reference to history for the explanation, Python
was a robber who dwelt near Parnassus, and extremely molested those who
passed that way to offer sacrifices. A prince, who bore the name of Apollo,
or a priest of that God, freed the country from him. This event gave oc-
casion to the institution of the Pythian gam‘es, so well known in Greece.
They were celebrated every fourth year: apples consecrated to Apollo,
or, as Pindar relates, crowns of laurei, were the prizes given to the
victors. Singing‚ dancing, and instrumental music, were used in those
games, beside the exercises mentioned in the fable.

This event, which Ovid places so near the subsiding of the deluge, must
have happened at a somewhat more distant time; since in the days of Deu—
calion, Apollo was not known at Delphi. It was Themis, agreeably to the
same poet and antiquity, who then delivered oracles there : there was also
another oracle before him, which was delivered by the earth.
