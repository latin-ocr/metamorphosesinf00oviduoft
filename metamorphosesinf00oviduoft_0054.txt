nxP. ΕΑΒ. x11. For the explanation of this fable‚ as well as the other
gallantries of the Gods, which the poets frequently mention, we must lay it
down as a principle, that, besides there being many Jupiter-s, many Aponus,
many Mercuries‚ Sto. the priests of those Deities frequently sanctified their
own debaucheries with the names of their divinities. From hence proceeded
that prodigious numberof children which claimed those Gods fortheirfathers.

This principle being established, we with ease can explain the fable of
Daphne. Some prince. who, for his love of polite learning, was named A·
pollo, fell in love with Daphne, daughter of Peneus, king of Thessaly, and
one day pursuing her, the young princess perished on the bank of a river,
in sight of her lover, and some laurels growing near the place, gave rise to
her metamorphosis3 or rather the etymology of the word Daphne, which
in Greek signifies a laurel‚ was the foundationof this fable.
