Exn. PAR. x111. The Greeks embellished their history with the princi.
pal events of Egypt and Phoenicia3 the faintest resemblance, either in names

or adventures, induced ‚them to confound their history with that of the
’ people from whom they derived their original. They would be thought
ancient3 and those who came first to people Greece having brought with
them the knowledge of their history and their religion, it cannot be a mat-
ter of surprise that their posterity assumed the honour of both. The fable
before us came originally from Egypt. Isis was the great Divinity of that
ancient people; she reigned over them soon after the disper-sion of nations,
and taug'ht them agriculture, and several other profitable and necessary
arts ε in acknowledgment of this, they made her a Divinith and her divine
rites passed with their colonies into foreign countries. Greece received
them when Inachus went to settle himself there, and in process of time,
Isis, or 10, was taken for his daughter, and the fable published in the man-
ner that ovid relates it. This is what is most to be depended on ; but as
something might have happened in Greece to have given rise to this fable,
it is necessary to shew in what manner the Greek authors explain it. Ap.
ollodorus, Strab0‚ Diodorus Siculus, and Pausanias, upon Homer's autho·
rsty, say, that Io was the daughter of Inachus, the first king of Argos; that
Jupiter took her away by force, and carried her to the Isle of Crete; that
he had a son by her named Epaphus, who went to reign in Egypt ; that his
mother having followed him thither, married Osiris, who was the same with
Apis, the son of Phoroneus, second king of Argos, and who, after his death,
was ranked among the Gods under the name of Serapis. To explain all the
circumstances of this fable, it is added, that Niobe, who had also th Ϊ ame
of J uno, according to the custom of those times, having conceived a j lousy
of that intrigue, put Io under the custody of her uncle Argus a most vigi.
lant person; that Jupiter ordered his confidant to kill him, and that his
mistress having embarked in a vessel for Egypt, which carried the figure of

a Clpw at ‘its head, the story of the transformation of that princess into one,
too its nse. > · ’ “
