of Juno, who, in the end, set her mad, by continually tormenting her with
gad flies. These have been so well noticed in the foregoiug explanations‚ as
to render it unnecessary to proceed further. But however, I shall point out
one observation necessary to be attended to, which is, that poets, as well
ancient as modern, have an indulgence that is not allowed to any other wri-
ters, and of which our author has made a most abundant use, by seizing
every the least circumstance that could support his invention, and allow him
the liberty (however simple and trifling the facts ) of working them by a
luxurIance of invention, to become marvelbus, of which the ancients were
particularly fond ; even the likeness of a name, whether to a thing animate
or inanimate, it mattered not rand, though their fables have their founda-
tion i'n history, yet they are so disfigured by a train of circumstances, that
more cannot be expected than to discover the fact or transaction that was
the foundation of the poet’s superstructure, without pursuing him through
the labyrinth of his ingenuity; this I shall endeavour to do, by shewing
whether the poet had taken to his assistance the transactions of history, ei-
ther sacred or profane. a
