Exn. FAB. xvx. Fronq history we leam, *that Argus, the fourth king
of Argos, called the city after his name. Many of the most eminent writers
among the ancients agree, that Argos was the son of Arestor, a prince that
so exceeded in wisdom and penetration‚ that he is said to have an hun·
dred eyes, and which is implied by the sui-name of Panoptes, given him

by the Grecian writers; to his care itis said 10 was committed for tuition, ‘-

b'ut that some prince of the name of Jupiter had him destroyed, that he
might ravish Io. This event is the foundation on which Ovid had display-
ed so much fiction and ingenuity in this fable.
