THE ARGUMENT.

s

Phaetom insulted by Epaphus, goes to the Palace of Apollo, to beseech him
to give sor-ne public acknowledgment of his being his son. Apollo having
sworn by the River Styx, not to refuse him any thing he should desire re-
specting that particular, he requested to guide Apollo’s Chariotfor a day,
in which he succeeded so ill, notwithstanding the instructions given him,
that the world was in danger ofbeing consumed, as he could not prevent
the Horses from running away with him, into tracts unknown before.
