NOTES.

129. Nec tibi, δῖα] Phoebus directs
Phaeton in the course he was to take3 for
says he, you must not go straight on through
the five circles, but through the zodiac,
which is oblique, and does not essceed the
limits of the three zones. This co‘urse may
be more readily explained by the sphere.

Directos arcus-l The parallel circles.

which are called Zones. For the heaven is
divided into five circla-s equally distant from
each other : sc. the Arctie (north Amare-
τίς, (somn) the tropic os Cancer, the tro-
pic of Capricorn aud the Equinoctial, which
is between them. The zodinc cuts the equi-
noctial obliquely, and reaches to the tro-
pies of (ancer and Capricorn¹ but does not
extend to the Arctic or Antarbtic, the polar
circles.

gives name to the pole. For Jupiter placed
Calisto‚ the daughter of Lycaon, v-lso
was changed by Juno into a bem-samono

plain path.

⁶39. Aram.] To the Antarctic Pole ι for
the altar on which the gods are first suppo-
sed to have entered into a coufederacy a-
gainst the Titans, is said to have been traus-
lated to heaven, and placed at the Amam-
tie l’ole 2 q. d. take care you be not carried
away too much toward the north, where
the snake is, or ιο the south, where is the
altar of the gods, a southern constellation.
140. Inter utrumque tene] keep in the
middle space between both. So Boukv 111.
