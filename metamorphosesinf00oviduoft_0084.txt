disflgured transactions in such a manner as to make it not discoverable from
what origin they came. Fables, in length of time, became moral, philoso-
phical', political, ἅτ. and so much in use, as to make it necessary, when any
great and interesting truth was to be conveyed, for to use them; of this we
have. many remarkable inmanem, both in the Old» and New Testament;
and if we consider this fable in a moral sense, the adventure of phaeton
may soon‘be applied and considered as the undertaking of a hot-headed
rash young man, who consulted his courage much more than his prudence.
But laying aside all allegory, Aristotle believed that in Phaeton’s days there
fell flames of fire from heaven, 'which consumed several cities; and his name
coming from Phaetho, has a strong affinity to hischaracter. Some attri-
bute the origin of this fable to what happened in the days of Joshua and
king Ezechias. St. Chrysostom supposes it 'to have taken its risc from
what is related in the Old Testament of the prophet Elias and his chariot,
and the more so from the nearness of the name to Elios, which is given by
the Greeks to the sun. Lucian in his discourse on astronomy, relateS‚ that
Phaeton was remarkable soz· his industry, to find out the course ofthe sun3
but that dying very young, lic left his observations uffiinished, which gave
occasion to some sects to say, that he did not know how to drive the cha*
riot of the sun to the end of its course.
