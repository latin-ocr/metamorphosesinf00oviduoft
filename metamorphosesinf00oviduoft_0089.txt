ΕΑΒ. V· CALISTO, LYCAONIS FILIA. A Jt-WE ADAMATA.

Jupiter, in taking a survey of the world, in order to extinguish what remaiued
of Phaeton's imprudence, falls in love with Calisto, whom he meets as he
passes through Arcadia; and, tue better to insinuate himself into her sa-
vour, assumes the appearance of Diana. Her sister nymphs acquaint that
Goddess with the deception put upon Calism, who discharges her from
her train as she had been deprived os her chastity.
