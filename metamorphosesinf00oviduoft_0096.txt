the chace, that she frequently appeared habited in the skins of the beasts
she killed. Jupiter, the second king of Arcadia, falling in love with her,
is the foundation of this fable. The manner of her life gave occasion to
our poet to connect her with Diana, whose *form Jupiter imnade to put on,
to deceive her, and Juno in resentment changed her into'a bear. On Ly-
caon‘s first discovering this constellation, she is said to be his daughter.
Juno's request to Thetis, that it might be excluded the ocean, is from its
never descending beneath our horizon. Her son Arcas dying young, was
t'ne occasion of his making-the constellation of the little bean—The change
which the poet has made ravens undergo, figuratively expresses odium, in
which the ancients held the officiously busy.

A virgin bearIng the name of Coronis, the mistress of Apollo, is changed ’
into a CZw, for an indiscreet report she made to Minerva, whose favour-
ite she was, concerning the basket in which Ericthonius was inclosed.
