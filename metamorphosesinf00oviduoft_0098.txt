EXP. ΕΑΒ. vlu. Apollodorus relates that Ericthonius the son of Cranae',
was bornfiin Attica, that he dethroned Amphictyon, and was the fourth king
of Athens, 1531 years before Christ. The Fame, as wrought by Pindar-
and ovid, has its foundation, on his being exposed as soon as born, in the
temple of Minerva. He is said to form the constellation called the Wag-

noner, and that the deformity in his legs occasioned his being supposed
half Man and half Serpent.
