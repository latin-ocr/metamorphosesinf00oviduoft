txx‘. PAB. lx. Notwithstanding Ovid's obligatior) to history, yet we find
he relates many facts of which history is totally silent, viz. Nyctimene's
commerce with her Father, Coronis’s-transformation into a CrOW‚ ὅτε. are
no other than allegories to convey somemoral truths, a method of convey-
ing instruction much practised by the ancients‚ ofwhich we have many in·
stane-es both in profane and sacred history. We have already observed
on what slendcr foundations the pocts have raised their fictions. All that
we can collect from history respecting Coronis and her commerce with
Apollo, or some priest of that (iod, is, that she gave birth to AEsculapius‚
aud that she died in her labour. Coronis, the imme of the nymph. is also
that of a crow, from whose egg it is said he was produced, and that he came
forth in the form ofa Serpent, which, in our days, is a symbol of physical
knowledge. Luciun's Dialogues.
