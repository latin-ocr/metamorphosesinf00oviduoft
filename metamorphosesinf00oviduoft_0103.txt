Exr. ΕΑΒ. x. Chiron, the inventor of physic, had the care of AEsculapius
given him. He was also a greatastronomer and 'magician‚ and had the educa-
tion of many ofthe heroes· A person of such accomplishments may well be
supposed notto have neglected his daughter’s talents‚ who, for herimprudence
in presumingonher knowledge to predicteventS, was turned intoa Mare. This
perhapshasno other foundation than her skill in riding, as her fatherwas so ex-
cellent an horseman, that he was called a Centaur‚ who is represented as half
Man and half Horse. The calendar, which Chiron has left us, is the first in
that way, and he is said to have lived about 1420 years before Christ, and
200 before the Trojan War.

ΕΑΒ. XI. BATTUS IN SAXUM.

Mercury, when stealingthe Oxen of Apollo, was discovered by Battus whom
he engages to secrecy by a present ; but, doubting the fidelity of the shep-
herd, he appears to him in another form, when by another‘ present he
found he was not to be depended upon, and, for his treachery, the God

changes him into a T euch-stone. γ
