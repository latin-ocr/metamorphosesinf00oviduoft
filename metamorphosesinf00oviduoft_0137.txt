ΠΡ. FAB. vn, 1„ the account of Narcissus, as wellas in that of Echo,
our poet has fully displayed the power of his genius3 Here he preseuts a
moving instance of theunhappy effects of sels-love, and an insensibility to
the love of another; he, with strokes os-the highest colouring‚ displuvs the
,absurdity of a self-admiring' youth, who from manners su‘itable to hs>- sex,
beeomes effeminate, and so much lost in folly and love of himself, as ω
become hateful both to the one and the other of the sexes. '

Pentheus not only treats with contempt the predictions of the Augur Ti·

’ resias‚ and forbids his people to worship Bacchus, ‘(then just arrived in
triumph to' Greece,)' but directs him to be vbound and brought before
him. The God, in the appearance of Acaetes‚ his companion, submits
to the indignit‘y‚ when he, in the Prince's presence, relates the wonder„-
performed by Bacchus, at which he is so much enraged, that he goes
in a fury to, Mount Cithaeron to disturb §he Oroies then celebrating
there; in resentment for this, his own Mother witff‘thse other Bacchants‘,
tear him in pieQeS.
