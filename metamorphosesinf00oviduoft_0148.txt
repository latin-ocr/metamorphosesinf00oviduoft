THE ARGUMENT.

X

The daughters of Minyas, negligent os the feast of Bacchus, entertain
themselves, during the ceremony, with the household concerns, and
relate several stories to fill up the time agreeably; of the number are
the adventures of Pyramus and Thisbe. These lovers appointed to meet
each other without the walls of Babylon: Thisbe first arrived3 but, on
seeing a Lioness‚ withdrew to hide herself in a cave, and in her hurry
and fright, dropt her scarf: Pyramus coming soon'after‚ and finding his
mistress·s scarf all bloody, supposed her devoured by some wild beast;
on this he kills himself with his sword. Thisbe having recovered from
her ssight, returns to meet her lover, when she is surprised by his dead
body, and suspecting the occasion of this melane-hely event,- plunges
the same fatal weapon into her own breast.
