EXP. FAB. 1, 11. 111. Sc 1v. From what is mentioned by Ovid in the close
of the Third Book, and the beginning of the Fourth, it is evident that the
introduction of the worship of Bacchus into Greece from Egypt, was at-
tended with other difficulties than the banishment of Cadmus, and the death
of his son Pentheus ; but his priests, who were interested‚ invented several
wonders said to be performed by their God‚ in order to gain him credit with
the people‚ which in those days of ignorance and superstition, was no very
difficult task. These were the supports of the Heathen worship, and out of
which, as the Scripture phrase is, the priests “sucked thereout no small ad-
vantage.'’ The story of Pyramus and Thisbe, which is given in the argu-
ment, and was related for the entertainment of the daughters of Minyas,
during tue feast of Bacchus, in whose debaucned and extravagant ceremo-
nies they could not unite, is one of those tragical events, that are fre·
quently the consequence of a sudden transport of the passions. Itis gene·
rally believed that a misunderstanding subsisted between the parents of the
lovers, and was the occasion of the fatal appointment‚ which should be a
lesson of admonition‚ as well to young persons, as their parents3 to the first,
that they do not enter rashly into engagements, and to the latter, that they
do not lay unreasonable commands on their children.

Not any author paints the Passions with greater strength ε and did hennot
sometimes draw his images too much at the expense of decency, the moral
of his fable would be the more engaging, and reason more triumphant3 but
it is Ovid's care to take advantage of the beart of man, and ever to showit
so much on the weak side, as that his Metamorphoses may be said to be
the triumph of the passions over the rational powers-
