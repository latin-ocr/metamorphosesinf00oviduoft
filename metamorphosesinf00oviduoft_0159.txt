EXP. ΕΑΒ. v. This sable, as well as many others ofovid, has its foundae
tion in some historica] fact; and the present, ‘on the execution of the law
which Vulcan, the king of Egypt, had framed for the suppression of adul-
tery ; and which his son, Sol, endeavoured to enforce, on an information
that a princess of the court had an inti-igue with one of his coni-flers, whose
apartment he abruptly enters in the night, and detects him, and who for
his crime is severely punished. We have already taken notice of our au-
thor sacrificing his delicacy to the indulgence of his genius and wit, which
is not more conspicuous in any one of his fables than the present.

ΕΑΒ. VI. LEUCOTHOE IN vaAM AUREAM. CLYTIE NYMPHA IN
HERBAM HELIOTROPIUM·

Leucothoe’s adventure with her lover the Sun, is out of resentment made
known to her father by Clytie, and'she is buried alive by her father's or-
ders : but the Sun grieved at the missortunes of a person so deur to him,

,, changes her into a Frankincense-Tree. The informer, who languishes fot·
love of Sol, is despised by him, and is at last changed into-the. Sun-
Flower. ¹ ·
