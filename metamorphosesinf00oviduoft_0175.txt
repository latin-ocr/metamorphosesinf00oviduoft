EXP. ΕΑΒ. xm. ἃ XIV. We have> already taken notice of the use· the
poet has made of the goddess June, (however it may refl'ectvon the character)
in the persecutione& Cadtnusxand hissami‘l-y. To proceed, Athamas having
married Ino; one of the daughters of Cadmus, J nno, in order to engage tho

Tisiphone to the palace of the unfortunate King‚ where she occasioned
most horrible disorders.

ovid, in his account of Athamas and his family, has so confined himself
to history, that we have little more to do, than to strip it of the marvenous,
and some of his poetical embellishments.——-Atharnas‚ the son of AEqus, and
grandson of Deucalion, upon the death of Themisto, his first wife, married
” Ιηο, the daughter of Cadmus, but divorcing her, he married· Nephele, and
had by her Phryxus and* Helle3 but she being divorced in her turn, Ino
was taken back, and had two sons Learchus and Melicerta. Ino not being
able to bear in her sight the children of Nephele, who, as the first-born, stood
in the way of her children in respect to their father's possessions, therefore
determined their destruction. Thebes, at this time, was affiicted with a sa-
mine, occasioned by the poisoning of the seed intended for the produce of
corn, and this by the contrivance of Ino; this made it necessary to consult
the God Apollo, whose oracle. by corrupting his priests, is said to have de·
clared‚ that the children of Nephele must be sacrificed to appease the anger
of the Gods. This coming to the knowledge of Phryxus, he privately left
the kingdom, taking with him his sister Helle and his father-’s treasures‚ and
sailed for Colchis, where he was kind'ly received by his kinsman Eta; but the
Princess, in her passage aver a Strait between Phrygia and Thrace, fell into
the sea, which was thence named* the Hellespont, a name it still retains-
These iniq-uitous proceedings coming to the knowledge of Athamas, he first-
kills Learchus, lno's favouri-te, and then went in pursuit of her, who, to escape
his fury, fied, taking her son Melicerta with hei-3 but finding herself pursued,
threw herself with hei- son from assrock into the sea; but the Gods, in corn„ ·
passion to this unfortunate family, changed them into Sea-Divinities, by the
names of Leucothoe and Palmum—The moral that may be gathered from
this Fable, is so obviousandz‘ntrikhxg, as to render it unnecessary to be more
particular.
