axv. rAss. xv. Cadmus is a ⁴remarkable instance of an unfortunate
Prince ; he was banished from Thebes, the very city whose foundation he
laid, and, with his dear Hermione, retii-ed into Illyria, where, borne down
by their missortunes, they died in each other’s arms. What is said of their
being changed into Serpems, arose from their ending their days with a
people, whose name iti the Hebrew language signified Serpems, which
Ovid would not omit to improve to his own design.

In the fate of Cadmus, we are furnished with a most excellent lessoa
and admonition against the ingratitude of the world, which is sc constant
au attendant on benevolence, as to seem inseparable from it.

MORTEM SUJ. NOMINIS.

Perseus, the son of Jupiter by Danae, having killed Medusa, carries her
head into Africa, where the blood that runs from it, produces abundance
of Snakes. Atlas, King of Mauritania, terrified at the remembrance of
an oracle that acquainted him that his Golden Frui: should be taken
from him by a son of Jupiter, directs Perseus, not only on that account,
to leave the kingdom, but uses violence to force him, whereupon the hero
presents to him the Gorgon’s head‚by which he is changed into a mountain.
