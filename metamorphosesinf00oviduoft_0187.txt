nxr. FAB. xvx. xvu. ὃς xum. For the better understanding the story
of Perseus, thch makes so considerable a figure in fabulous history, it
will be necessary to go sornewhat further back than Ovid has done, to
show his lineage, and how he came to be the son of Jupiter and Danae,
the daughter of Acrisius, king of Argos, The Oracle having declared to
the king that he would be killed by his grandson, he therefore confined
his daughter Danae' in a brazen tower; but Jupiter, who was enamoured
ofher, for his easier admittance into the tower‚ descended in a shower οῖ’
gold. vPraetus, the king’s brother, who was also in love with her, cor-
rupted her keepers by a d1stribution of some of the golden shower; the
consequence waS, that Danae* was delivere‘d of a son, which coming to her
father’s knowledge, he ordered both her and her son to be committed to
the mercy of the sea in a bas‘ket, and they were cast on the coast of Seri-
phus, where Polydectes reigned. This Prince gave thern a genez-ons re.
ception, and educated Perseus; but in some time, being· smitten with the
charms of Danae, he encouraged him to seek adventures, and advised him
to make war against. the Gorgons,-whose names were Stheno, Euryale, and
Medusa, daughters of Phorcus and Ceto, and who were said to bave but
one eye amongst them. Perseus, in his engagement with the Gorgons, cut
off Medusa’s head, and from the blood that flowed, sprung up the hero
Chrysaor, and the winged horse Pegasus. The head of Medusa was fablcd
to have snakes entwined in the hair, and her face the power of changing
the spectator into stone. Some have supposed these females possessed
three islands in the Atlantic‚ and had in their treasury a golden statue of
Minerva, all which were placed under the management ofa single person,
which occasioned it to be said, they had but one eye. At this time, one Pei-⁴
scus, a fugitive of Argos„ plundered the coasts, and having heard of this·
treasure, was resolved to possess it; for which purpose hc surprised their
minister, which'gave the poet an opportunity of saying, he had taken their
eye. Perseus acquaints them he would exchange him sor the Gorgon (the
golden statue 3) this was objected to by Medusa, whose head he cut off:
on getting possession of the Gorgon he broke it, and placed the head at
the prow of his ship. The fame of this exploit kept the neighbouring
Princes in such awe of him, that it was said Medusa·s head turned his ene-
mies into stones. This report was countenanced by Perseus, as it contri-
buted not a little to the terror of his arms; for, landing on the island of
Seriphus‚ Polydectes with his people immediately fied; so that finding not

ang {ll-ring l{tanaining but the stones, it was said he had petrified the king
an is su Jects.

The accounts left usiby the ancients respecting the Gorgons, are so con-
tradictory, that little can be offered respecting them. But in order to ex-
plain the most considerable circumstances of the fable, we must suppose
Pegasus, said to be produced from the bloo'd of Medusa, as well as Chrys-
εον, to be two ships that were found where Medusa resided‚ which Per-
seus carried off after he had killed that princess, and whose prows were
ornamented with the figure of winged horses, which gave rise to the fable,
and occasioned it to be said, that Mercury gave him wings, and a sword
bent like a reap-hook; Minerva lending him her shield‚ and Pluto his hel-
mct3 whereby were figured the rapidity of his conquest, the sure measures
taken, and the profound secrecy he had observed. By what the poets say
os coral being produced from the blood of Medusa, we are to understand,
that by the defeat of the Gorgons‚ the African coast became more sre-
quented by the people employed in searching for that plant.

It is generally believed the Cape Verd Islands were anciently called the
