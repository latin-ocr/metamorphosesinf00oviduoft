Gorgons, from whence Perseus passed into Mauritania, where the famous
Atlas reigned; but that prince, being warned with respect to a son of Ju-
piter, denied Perseus the rights of hospitality, on which he presented the
head of Medusa, and turned him into stone; or more probably, killed him
in that mountain which has ever since been called by bis name. It is said
that he carried off the Golden Apples that grew in the garden of the Hes-
perides, of which a Dragon had the care; that is, he plundered the Prince
of Mauritania. It is very probable these apples were th‘e mines discovered
by Atlas, that were guarded by men and dogs; or sheep, which were so
remarkably fine in this country, that they were called the Golden Sheep-
or else Oranges and Lemons (so famed in the poets) gathered in the gar
den of Tingitana, where they abound.

Perseus is said to have passed from Mauritania to Ethiopia, where he
released Andromeda from the fury of a sea-monster3 for Cassiope, on pre-
suming to suppose her daughter more beautiful than the Nereides, was
ordered by the oracle of Ammon to expose her on a rock, to the fury ofa
monster, which was to be sent by Neptune, as we learn from Ovid and
others. The foundation of this fable is as follows: Andromeda, who was
contracted to her uncle Phineus, was demanded in marriage by a very
proud and brutish prince who infested their cda‘sts; and this coming to the
knowledge of Perseus, he engages and kills the pirate, so the damsel be-
came his prize. In some paintings, the prince is represented as engaged
with a monster in single combat.

From this fable we learn how early Gold became the chief instrument of
, corruption, and. how forcibly it acted, even to make its way through gates
of brass! No wonder then, it so frequently reaches the recesses of* the
heart of man, fatal to Virtue, fatal to Freedom! In the Senabe of Rome,
all the insults and glaring guilt of J ugurtha were of no force against the
power of his money. The Senate not only openly defended, but extolled
this Son of Blood! they were overtaken, however, in due time, by the
vengeance of an oppressed people, whom they deemed of no further con-
sequence in the Commonwealth‚ than as they paid enormous taxes to sup-
port thez'r profligacy3 and in the end, they were all involved in general
ruin. Thus fell Rome and her liberties by the power of gold, which no
less fatally threatens some modern states, by the unhappy influence of its
corrupting power.
