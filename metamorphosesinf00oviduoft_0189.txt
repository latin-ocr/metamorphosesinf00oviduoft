THE ARG UMENT⁴

As Perseus continues the relation of Medusa's adventures, Phineus, to
whom Andromeda had been promised in marriage, rushes with a crowd
of friends into the palace‚ and furiously attacks his rival: the combat is
obstinate and bloody on hoth sides, and in it Perseus gives distinguished

proofs of his valour.
