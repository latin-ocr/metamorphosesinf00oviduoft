NOTE S.

175. Plaga] The stroke, the wound.

Trepidurn.] This word is usually trans-
lated trembling‚ which is not its signification 3
sor trepido, as, from which it is derived, sig-
nifies to be in such a hui-ry and confusion
upon any sudden alarin, as not to know
which way to turn sor sal'ety3 thus,

‘⁸ Trepidant immisso himine Manes.” Virg.
and Horace, speaking of the city and coun-
try mouse, ⁴

‘⁴ Exanimes trepidare, simul-domus alta

Personuit canibus.” ’ [ Molossis,
Here trepido is used iu its true and primary
signification. Hence, secondly, it §lgnifies
simply to hasten through apprehension of,
danger, or with any kind of tumultuous
eagcrness.

¹⁴ Ne trepidate meaS, Teucri, defendere
trepidantia bello ’ [naves.
Corda licet longe praesciscere.'’ Virg. ⁴

 

and applied to inanimate things by meta»
phor3 to hasten with a tremulous motion.
' ¹¹ Flammae trepidant rotantes, ἃς.
-———‹ obliquo ‘laborat
Lympha fugax trepidare rivo.’‘ Hor.
&dij Merely‚ to be in a great hurry, to
run. -

‘⁴ Dum trepidant alae, &c.'’ Yirg.
.“ Octavum trepidavit aetas
claudere lustrum. '. Hor.

4thly. And as the mind in this state is
not without seam, it signilies also to fear, to
be dismayed; but not to quake ‘with sear,
or to trenlee, as it is generally translated⁴
So in this place trepidum significs dismayed,
ali'rightcd. ’

176. Cyllenide] Cyllenian, for he re-
ceived this wcapon from Met-cury, born
in Cyllene, a mountain os Arcadia, aud
sometimes called Cyllenus,

Perseus, notwithstanding his valour, being apprehensive of the danger he
stood in from the number of his enemies, (having first catitioned his
friends,) presented to them the Gorgon's head, when immediately Phi-
neus and his companions were turned into Statucs. Perseus having now
vanquished his-enemies, goes with Andromeda to Argos, his native
city, where he turns the usurper Proetus into Stone, and restores his
grandfather Acrisius to his kingdom, notwithstanding his ill treatment

of him. Sec his History, p. 173.

NOTES.

1„ Virtutem] Scil. suam, his valour, his
bravery: from vis, strength, comes Vir, a
man; and therefore vir is distinguished
from homo, the former signifying a man of
strength and fortitude in mind and body, the
latter a mere man, one of the human species:
and from Vir comes Virtus, which denotes
that contage and fortitude which is the cha-
racteristico? man, and this is the first signi-

fication of Virtus, but it signifies als'o every ’
accomplishment of the human mind.
-Succumbe1·c.] Sink under the numberof

*his enemies.

2. Cogitis.] You force me to this.

3. Ab hoste] From Medusa's head.

Petam.} 1 will seek.

5. Miracula moveant-J Whom thy prodi-
gies may terrify.
