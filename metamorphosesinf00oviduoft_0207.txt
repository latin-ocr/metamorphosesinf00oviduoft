EXP. ΕΑΒ. vx. The ancients, from their ignorance of natural history,
were notssable to account for the different appearances of natureon any ra.
tional foundation, therefore attributed them to some supernatural cause.
Of this we have not a more remarkable instance than that to which thev
attributed the burning, and the different eruptions of Monnt Aitna, anil
which Ovid has displayed with all the luxuriance of fancy, in his descrip-
tion of the victory of the Gods over Typhoeus—In the Argument we have
mentioned Pluto’s expedition, on which we shall only observo, that as his
taking off Proserpine is one of the' most considerable events in fabulous his-
tory, ovid has ushered it in'with the greatest pomp and'magnificence that
we can suppose the subJect could be attended with.

Proserpine is surprised by Pluto in the fields of Enna, from whence hc car¹

through grief for the ravished Goddess and her slighted privilege& she
dissolves into a Fountain. Ceres goes every where in search of her ‹laugh-
ter‚ and, in her travels, changes Stellio, sor his impertinence‚ into a Li-
zard.
