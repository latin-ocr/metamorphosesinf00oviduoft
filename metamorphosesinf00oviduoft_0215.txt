EXP. FAB. vn. VIII. and x. The rape of Proserpine‚ which is held
in such estimation in the Heathen mythology, was designed to commemo-
rate a great famine in G* eece, in the reign of Erechtheus. The Athenians‚
who were under the necessity of going into Egypt to buy corn, brought.
from thence the worship paid to the deity of the Egyptians, who presided.
over agriculture. This was soon adopted by the Athenians‚ in expectation
that it would protect them from the like calamity for the future. The Itali-
ans having received the rites of Ceres or Isis, somewhat earlier than the
Athenians‚ gave occasion to its being said, that they came from Sicily to
Athens. The loss which Ceres had in her daughter, we must understand,
was the want of fruit and corn, which her name implies3 and her confine»-
ment in hell, to signii'y the unprofitable retention of the seed in the earth.
But on this calamity ceasing, it was said that Jupiter had compromised all
differences between Pluto and Ceres, by his permitting her daughter to re·
side with her six months of the year, and the other six with Pluto, figura-
tively implying the time the seed is concealed in the earth, and its return in
harvest. Ascalaphus being turned into an owl,is rewarded for his busy infor-
mation. The others that are mentioned, arose from the affinity of their
names to the things they were changed to, which Ovid’s genius could not
resist. ‘ ·

FAB. Χ. ARETHUSA NYMPHA IN FONTEM SIBI COGNOMINEM.

The Muse continues the rehem-sal of the song, in which is related the ‚satisff
faction Ceres declared at Jupiter’s decree respecting her daughter. Be· ⁷
ing thus pacified, she returns to Arethusa, to-inquire οῖ’ her the history
of her adventures. The Nymph entertains the Goddess with the love ot
Alpheus, and his pur-suit of her; to avoid whom she imploret} the assis-
tance of Diana, who changed her into a sountain.
