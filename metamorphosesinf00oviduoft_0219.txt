Ex. FAB. X. The circumstance which gave birth to this Fable was, that
in Sicily there was a fountain called by the inhabitants Arethusa; but the
Phoenicians coming to settle there, possessed the same, and give it the
name of Alpheus, which in both languages‚ signified the Fountain of
Willows. On this are founded the loves of Alpheus and Arethusa, so tinely
displayed by Ovid.

ΓΑΒ. xx. LYNCUS unx m trucem.

Ceres, for the better propagating the knowledge of Husbandry‚ dispatches
Triptolemus, with orders, every where'to cultivate the earth: thev Prince
obeys her, and after traversing both Europe and Africa, arrives in
Scythia, where Lynceus reigned3 who being envious that so great a.
kindness should be attributed to the messenger of Ceres, attempted to
kill him, that he himself might haye the honour, but in the instant of
putting his wicked design into executionfhe is changed into a Lynx.
The Muse finishes the song, with the metamorphosis οἱ the Pierides into
Magpies, for their contention with the Muses.
