The king, in his rage, drawing his swerd to kill his wife and sister-in-law,
they escaped on board a sbip provided for the purpose, and arrived at
Athens. In the remote ages, the adventures of persons of distinction
were ever blended with the marvellous; so here we find the intervention of

events related in this history are remarkable instances of those calamities'
which constantly pursue the wicked. The extraordinary manner in which
Philomela made known her situation, does most beautifully show the super-
intendance of a being far superior to man.

sons, Calais and Zethes; who, as they grow up, get wings like their
father, and embark with Jason -in search of the Golden Fleece.
