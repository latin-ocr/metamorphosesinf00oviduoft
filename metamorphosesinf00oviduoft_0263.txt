mise of marriage, the princess engaged to assist him in his design of pos-
sessing himself of her father’s treasure, for which purpose she delivered him
a kev, by the help of which he accomplislied his design, and then re-em-
barked, taking Medea with him. This historical narrative, which we have
just related, is supposed to have been written in the Phoenician language,
which the Grecians not understanding‚ invented the fabulous account of
an ever-watchsul dragon, and bulls breathing fire, as guarding the Golden
Fleece3 this gave importance to the expedition, and shewed the dangers
they had encounte‘red. The Golden Fleece or Ram is said to have been
dedicated by Phyneas to Jupiter, on his arrival at Colchis: he consecrated
'the skin in the Grove of Mars, called it‘ the Golden Fleece from its colour,
and, as it was said, had it guarded hy bulls breathing fire, and a watchful
dragon that never slept.

In the Phoenician langnage, Gaza signifies either a treasure or a fleece;
Sasu· a wall, or a bull; and in that ancient langnage, brass, imm, and a
dragon were all expressed by the same word. Thus, instead of saying that
Jason‚by the counsel and assistance of Medea, carried away AEe‘ta’s treasure,
it is reported he was ob!iged to engage with bulls and dragons, and to
make use of inchantments. We cannot omit observing with what beauty
the poet has embellished his fiction, by the contentions he has raised in the
breast of Medea, betweenxher duty to her parentS, and the love she owed
to Jason, whom she had engaged for a husband.

Jason, on his return to Iolcos, entreats Medea to restore his father AEson
to Youth, which she performs, and then goes to the Court of Pelias,
where she artfully revenges the Injuries he had done Jason’s Family, by
making him the Victim of the abused Credulity of his own Daughters ς
who, in compliance with her dissembled Kindness, stabs him to death.—
Medea, having executed her Design, makes her escape in her Chai-iot.
