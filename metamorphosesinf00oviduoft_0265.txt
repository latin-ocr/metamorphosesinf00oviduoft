NOTES.

530. Sidera sola.] The stars alone are upon
duty, the rest of the creation sleeps.

31. Ten] Three was a mysticat number
among the ancients‚ and reverend 111 1911-
gion3 they had three Graces, three Furies,
&e in like manner was three multiplied by
three, nine3 and nine again multiplied by
three, twenty-seven, for which reason· you
will find ‘27 boys and as many girls, singing
the Carmen Seculare in Horace.

5⁴2. Irroravit.] She sprinkled.—Ternis‚
ἃς. She opened her mouth three times.

55. Submisso poplite.] With bended
huces. ’

54. Nox, &ej The poet. describes the
invocationi. and prayers os Medea to be such
as are most ise-fitting an enchantress.

Diurnis ignibus] To the Sun-

56. Triceps Hecate] Ἰξικὲῠαλῦς, who
h'as on the right side the head of an horse, 011

57. eamusque] EnchantmentS.

40. Adeste-J Be present to my assist-
snt-0.

41· Quorum ope, &c.] When the ancients
{ir-'ol-ed'thcir gods, they enumeratcd all the
attributes and epithcts they could think ps,
Ι hoping by such flattergc tc presure thei: at-

tention and assistance. You will find this
absurd custom of adoration ridiculed with
muchhumour by Lucian, where Timon 111-
vokes Jupiter. These words, quorum ope.
are understood to belong to every principat
verb from rediere to the end of V. 51⁴.

43. Stantia freta.] The quiet calm sea.

46. Viva saxa-J The rocks are called
viva, living, when they are in a state of
nature, lying in the earth as nature left

49. Te quoque, ἃς] Τ119 common peo-
ple, who' knew not the cause of an eelipse,
had a' notion that the moon at such times
was forced down from heaven faint and sich,
and all this by the power of some erich-'tnt-
r'ess ; upon which occasion they tinkled
brass, to drawn,¹ as it were, the witch¹s
voice, which ceremony they obser-red to
recover the moon, (that is) to restore her
to her former light: not knowing that
this must have happened, though 110 such
noise had been made.

Traho.] I draw dov'vn from heaven, 1 al-

lure; for witches are feigned to draw tha
1110011 from heaven by their verses.

famous for brazs,
