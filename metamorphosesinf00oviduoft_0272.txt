treasure, than he was pursued by a very considerable force, under the
command of Absyrtus, Medeas brother3 who, with her usual dexterity,
avails herself and Jason of this danger, by sending to acquaint her brother
that she went off with the Greeks very much against her inclinatior), and if
he would but come priv ately to 3 place agreed upon, she would be indebted
to him sor liei lil›er.ty T he prince not suspecting any deception, came there
unattended and unarmed, where he was 3553551331οὼ and tn delay the enemy
in their pursuit, his mangled limbs were scatter'ed 111 the way, which gave
the Greeks an opportunity to embark. Soon after arriving at 111015131111 ot
