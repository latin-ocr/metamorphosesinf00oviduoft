wholly silent. However, the following observations may, in general, serve
as a key to them, viz.; To escape any imminent danger, was to be turned
into a Bird ; to avoid a pursuit, to be concealed in a Cave, or transformed
into Serpents z if forced into tears, that was to become a t'ountain ; if
young persons are said to be lost in a wood, they become Nymphs or Dry-
ads. The likeness of names, as has been observed, offered a ready hint for
a metamorphosis, viz.: Alopis into a Wolf; Cygnus into a Sw'an3 Coronis
into a Crow; Cerambis into a Beetle. A proper attention to these will
explain many of the sables related here3 but such as have a connexion with
historical facts, we shall more particularly consider. That of the women
of Cos being changed into Cows, has its foundation in the cruelty of Her-
cules’s companions‚ who sacrificed some of them to the gods of the coun-
try: that of the inhabitants of Rhodes being changed into Roeks, from
their perishing in an inundation. The great fruitfulness of the daughter of
Alcidamas, was expressed by her being turned into a Dove: the rage and
despair of Maera, by her transformation into a ssi-tch„ ' The metamorphosis
of Menephron into a brute beast, shews the horror in which his incest was
held. Arne was changed into a Daw, for her avarice in selling her country,
as that bird is reported to love money. The metamorphosis of Philyre,
the mother of Chiron, the Centaur, into a Linden-‘Treffi is what her name
expressed in the Greek language.

Hercules chains the dog Cerberus, who guarded Hell. Theseus, after his
exploits in Corinth, arrives at Athens, where being unknown to his fa-
ther, and Medea conceiving some unfavourable apprehensions respecting
him, she prepares for him a cup of poison; but the king, luckily disco*
vel-ing him to be his son, just at the instant he is going to drink, snatches
the cup from him, when instantly the Sorceress flies off in her chamot.
AEgeus then makes a solemn feast to celebrate the Prince's arrival and
preservation; in the mean time Minos, King of Crete, solicits several
Princes to assist him in a war against Athens, to revenge the death of
his son Androgeus, who had been mur-dered there.
