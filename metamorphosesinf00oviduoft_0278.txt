figure in fabulous history, has his origin from the Egyptians, whose Mum«
mies heis said to have guardeil. The Grecian history relates that, in the
Cavern Taenarus, there was a Serpent which ravagcd the adjacent country ;
and as this place was supposed to be one os the avenues to l’luto’s kingdom,
this Serpent was called his Porter. It is observed that Homer was the first,
that called Cerberus a Dog‚ whose name signifies one that devours -flesh.-
By the poisonous herb-s, said to grow from the soam of Cerberus, we are to
understand, that they were found in great abundanee there, and the ill use
made of them by some women of Thessaly, was the occasion of their being
called Witches. The figure of Cerberus, which was brought from Egypt
by Sir Paul Lucas, and remains now in the cabinet of Mons. de Boze, is re-
presented with the heaits of a Man, a Dog, and a Monkey, with Serpents
entwined round the three lit-ads, their tails making several folds about tho
legs,
