ῈΧΡ. FAB. rx. Minos the Second, upon his accession to the throne (ιὲ
his father Lycastes, made several conquests in the islands adjoining to Crete,
where he reigned, and at last became master of the sea. His son Androgeus
he sent to Athens, who entered as a comba'tant in the games celebrated
there, and became so successful, that he was greatly caressed by the sons
of Pallas, brother to AEgeus‚ which occasioned such suspicions in the
breast of the latter, that he caused Androgeus to be murdered on his wav
to Thebes. The infamy of this action, the Athenians endeavoured to cori-
ceal, by reporting he was killed by the Marathon Bull, which ravaged
Greece. The adventures of the war that the death of Androgeus occasi»
oned, are still to be related.
