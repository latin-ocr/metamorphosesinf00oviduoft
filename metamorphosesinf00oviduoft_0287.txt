Exn. FAB. x. Minos, having traversed the Isles of Oliaros, Didymus,
Tenos, and Andros, staid some time in Aigina, where AEacus reigned.
Surprised at not meeting with any of his old acquaintance, he was informed
by the king of the ravages made amongst his subjects by the plague‚ and
that Jupiter had replaced them, by transfor-ming into men the ants that
were in an hollow tree; which we can suppose to be no other than the re-
turn of his people‚ who had fied to the woods to avoid the contagion.
The affinity of their name in Greek to that of ants, gave riSe to the story

Cephalus, having resisted the entreaties of Aurora, who fell? in love with
him as he was hunssng, returns in disguise to his wife Procris, to try the
sincerity of her affection, which beginning to waver, he makes himself
known, and the discovery so provokes her, that she flies to the woods,
and turns huntress‚ with a resolution never to see him more. She is
afterwards, upon his submission, reconciled to him, and bestows on him
a Dog and Dart, which Diana had given her. The Dog is turned into
stone when in chase of a wild beast, which Themis had sent to ravage
the territories of ThebeS‚ according to the interpretation of the Sphinx’s
Riddle by Oedipusi
