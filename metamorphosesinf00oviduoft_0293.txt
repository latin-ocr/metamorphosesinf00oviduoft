that there were two princes of the name of Cephalus : one the son of Mer-
cury, and Herse the daughter of Cecrops‚; the other the son of Deioneus‚
king of Phocis, and Diomeda the daughter of Xuthus. The first was car-
ried off by Aurora, with whom he lived in >Syria; where he had a son named
Python the father of Phaeton. The second married Procris, the daughter
of Erectheus, king of Athens· The latter is the one mentioned by ovid,
who after he had pai-ted from Aurora, returned to Procris, as will appear
in the following fable.

FAB· XIII· PROCRIS PRO FERA OCCISA.

Procris, in her turn, suspecting the virtue of Cephalus, goes to the Forest
which she supposes to be the scene of his intrigue. He, hearing a rust-
ling noise in the thicket, wherein she conceals herself, imagines there is a
wild beast ; and immediafely letting fly his javenn, which she had pre-
sented him with, kills her.
