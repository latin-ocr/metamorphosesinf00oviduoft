exp· ΕΑΒ. xtra· Cephalus, theson of Deroneus, king of Phocis, was
a most a'ccompl'i‘shed Prinos, but had a great passion for hundng, which in-
duced him to rise soearly, that it was said, he was in love with Aurora.
This report was much cou‘nter'ianced by his wife Procris. in order to lessen‘
the criminality of her own conduct ; which coming to the knowledge of her
prince, he forsook the fields, and returned to' Thoricus. where his queen re-
sided‚ who, when she heard of this, retired to the court of Minos the Se-
cond, where that prince fell in love with her; on this his wife Pasiphae, to
be revenged of his infidelity, intrigued with Taurus, one of the captains of
his court, who afterwards became remarkable in history. This intrigue the
Greeks, iu resentment to Minos, represented much to the dhshqnom, both
of the queen and himself. .

Pasiphae's revengc not being yet sufficicntly satiSfietL she qudeavoured t'o
‹lestroy her rival Procris, by poisoning her bed. which coming to her know-
ledge, she returned to Thon-icus, when Cephalus took her again in'to favour:
on which she' presented him with the famous dog Lanam, and the myste-
rious dart, so much celebrated by the poets.

Just at this time, a monstrou's fox was sent by Themis, to ravage the
Theban territories, whose inhabitants obliged themselves to give him one ot*
their children each mouth, to prevent a greater destruction of them. Am-
phitryon, who was to be married to Alcmena, as soon as he avenged him-
sels of the T eleboe's. who had killed her brothers, went for this purpose to
Thebes, to request the assistance of Creon, which he could not procure upon
any other condition, than his promising to free his country from -the‘ Fox'.
This he agreed to, and for the better accomplishing it went to Athens, where
Cephalus then resided, to engage him with his dog and dart, to' which Ce-
phalus readily conSented, and set offfoi· Thebes, where his dog Laelaps pur.
'sued the Fox so closely that he had taken him, but that Jupiter at the ir.-
stant turned them both into stenes. After this chace Amphitryon made
war on the Teleboe's, whom he conquercd‚ giving to Cephalus the island
ot' Cephalenla‚ situated iu the· Ionian sea, over against Acarnania. lt was
in this war, that Corneto, being charmed with the beauty of Cepheia& cut
the fatal lock, upon which the life and kingdom ot'her father Pterelas de-

{ended ; that is, she formed a conspiracy against him. Amphitryon, with ,

ner assistance, made himself master of Taphos; and Cephalus, who was re-
conciled to his wife, shewed the unnatural Corneto so much contempt, that
she thrcw herself froin the promontory of Leucas.
Notwithstanding the reconciliation between Cephalus and Procris, yet, as
he killed her iu hunting‚ he was so much suspected of having some remulus or
