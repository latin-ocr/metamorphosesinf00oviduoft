ΕΧΡ. ΕΑΒ. 1. In the argument to this fable, and the historical narrative
added to the preceding, we have so fully related what regards Minos, the
success of his arms against king Nisus, and the treachery of his daughter,
as to render it unnecessary to take any further notice of them here. The
reality of the adventure must have been, that Scylla held a correspondence
with Minos during the siege, and acquainted him with the resolution of
her father's councils; and in the end let him into the town, having stolen
the keys of the gates from her father while asleep. This is what Ovid had
in memory when he speaks of the lock Nisus had on his head. The meta·
morphosis of the princess into a lark, and her father into a particular sort
of eagle, he was led into from the resemblance their names had to each,
one in the Greek, and the other in the Hebrew language.

FAB. 11. ARIADNE IN CORONAM,

Minos, in prosecuting the war, overcomes the Athenians, and iinposes on
thern a tribute of a number of youths and virgins, of their best families,
to be exposed to the Minotaur. The lot falls on Theseusffwho, by the
assistance of Ariadne, kills that monster, disengages himself from Dae-
dalus’s Labyrinth, and carries her off to the island of Naxus, where he
leaves her. There Bacchus pays his addresses to her; and, to immorta-
lize her name, transforms the crown he had given her into a constellation,
