man, and was called the Minotaur‚ being the fruit osan unnatural inti-igue
which Pasiphae the king's wife had with a bull, sent by Neptune, and kept
in a labyrinth, construeted by Daedalus. This fable has for its foundation
the following historieal facts ε While Minos was prosecuting the wars he had
engaged in to revenge his son’s death, his wife Pasiphae had an intrigue
with one of the Cretan lords of his court, named Taurus, which was coun-
tenanced by Daedalus, as he suffered them to meet at his house ; the queen
was afterwards delivered of twins‚ one resembling Minos, and the other Tau-

rus. The combat the young Athenians were engaged in, was at the funeral Ι

games, instituted by Minos in honour of his son Androgeus, where they
who were conquered became the property of the conqueror. In these con-
tentions Taurus was not less successful than cruel to the vanquished ; which
occasioned it to be said they engaged with a monster. Theseus’s success
was owing to his captivating Ariadne, the king‘s daughter, who gave him

, the plan that Daedalus (a famous architect and statuary) had drawn of the

Labyrinth he had built, by which he released himself, after defeating the
monster. The remainder you have in the argument.

Daedalus, tired of his exile, finds means to escape from Crete, by making
himself wings. His son Icarus, neglecting his Father’s advice, flies so
near the sun that he melts his wings, and perishes in the sea, which has
ever since been called after him. Daedalus's sister places ha· son Perdix

phew’s genius, casts him from a tower, with an intent to kill him; but
Minerva, always a favourer of arts‚ supports him in his fall, and trans-
forms him into a partridge.
