Exn. ran. vn. vm. 1x. ἃ x. The sable of Philemon and Baucis, related
by our poet in so easy and natural a manner, is one of those which displays
the hospitality the ancients were remarkable for, and which seldom went
unrewarded. The persons in this fable are not so much as guessed at, so
totally are they unknown in history3 nor would I choose. with Mr. fluet,
to make so bold a conjecture, as to suppose it a disfiguration of the visit
the angels made t0.Abraham; yet Ι am satisfied that Ovid is indebted to
the sacred writings (whose language we can have no doubt os his being
familiar with) for many of the fine allusions and embellishments given to
his fables. The fable of Proteus is ingenious and entertaining, affording
the mind a pleasing expanse. We may suppose him an oratos, who never
failed to gain his auditore by the force of his eloq‘uence; and Herodotus
says Proteus was a prince extremely wise, just, ‘and eloquent. From his
experience he knew what was to happen; and his prudence was such, as
made his designs impenetrable3 and as it was said, he must be surprised
and tied by those who had α mind io discover them. Sometimes he is seen in
the midst of his soldiers. as a sliepherd in the midst of his flock: these are
the flocks of Neptune, which it is said he had the care of. Passionate and
violent to such excess, as he is said to be all on fire; but so much master
of his passions, as to appear in a moment calm and unruffled. From all
this we may suppose the poet intended an allegorical delineation of a king,
wire andereseeing, subtle and contriving ‚- and not the history of the fabu-
lous Proteus said to change his form and figure.

rltss. xl. METRA IN‘VARIAS SPECIES. Χ

Achelous continues his relation with the story of Meti-a, daughter of Eri·
sichthon‚ who was attached with an insatiable hunger, for having sacri-
legiously cut down an oak, sacred to the goddess Ceres. Metra begged
of Neptune, who had been in love with her, the power of assuming dif-
ferent shapes; that she might, if possible, satisfy her father’s voracious
appetite. For this purpose Erisichthon was frequently obliged to expose
her to sale, but he always recovered her again, from the power she had
of changing her form3 and this he continued to do until the deception
became publicly known. At last he became the avenger of his own
impiety, by being forced to devour himself.
