established peace. Such authors as have related this event, treat it in a
fabulous manner, by saying he fought with the god of the river, who
changed himself into a serpent ; meaning thereby the windings and turnings
of the river; and afterwards into a bull, to express the fury of its course,
and rapid overflowing of its banks, the occasion of great devastation, which
the ancients frequently expressed by this figure. Hercules is said to have
overcome the bull, and to have broken off one of his horns, which is ex..
pressive of ’ his confining the two branches of the river in one channel; and
hence, as Strabo writes, the Horn of Plenty, as the frequent mischiefs of
its inundation now ceased. However, the Horn of Plenty is often under-
stood to be that of the Goat Amalthea, which nursed Jupiter. The nymphs
gave this to Achelous, who afterwards exchanged it with Hercules for that
which he had torn from him. Dejanira being given to Hercules, as the re-
ward of the services he did Oeneus, king of Calydon, it is fabled she had
been promised to Achelous, who was vanquished in a combat with his an-
tagonist. This is the foundation of that famous engagement which our
poet so beautifully describes as if actual between these two heroes.

Hercules returning with Deianira, the prize of his victory, cominits her to
the care of Nessus the centaur‚ who was to take her over the river
Evenus; but Nessus is so smitten with her charms‚ that he attempts to
carry her off, while Hercules remains on the other side of the river.
