Hercules, percciving Nessus's design‚ prevents his accomplishing it by
wounding him with an arrow. The Centaur, when just expiring, (in order
to be avenged of him,) gives Dejanira his coat dipt in his blood3 assuring
her it contained a charm against the infidelity of her husband. She,
hearing that Hercules was in love with Iole, sends him the enat, in hopes
it might have that effect. As soon as he puts it on, he is seized with
racking pains and suchvviolent fits of madness, that he throws Lychas,
who brought him the coat, into the sea, where he was changed into a
rock. Hercules, in obedient-e to a response ot* the oracle he had con-
mlted, prepares a funeral pile, and resolutely lays hirnself on it; his
friend Philoctetes lights it 2 und the hero, aster a recital of his labours,

expires in the flames. When his body is consumed, Jupiter translates ,

him to the heavuns, and places him amongst the Gods.

notes, descrihing the labours os Hercules, refer to the explication os that
hcro's labeum, which follow Fables V. and Vl of this Book.
