exn. ΕΑΒ. 11. 111. δε 1v. Hercules, on his departure* from the court of
Calydon, went to Trachina, in order to be absolved by Ceyx, the king of
that territory, of the murder he had committed; but as he was to pass the
river Evenus, which had overflowed its banks, he directed Nessus the Cen-2
taur, to take his' wife Dejanira to the other side, while he crossed it by
swimrning. No sooner had Hercules got to a considerable distance, than
the Centaur attempted to carry her off ; Hercules perceiving his design‚
wounded him with an arrow, which had been poisoned with the blood of
the Hydra. The Centaur, finding his wound mortal‚ resolved (m revenge,
and dipped his Tunic in th‘e blood that flowed from the wound, which he
gave to Dejanira, ,assuring berit would prove an effectual charm against the
infidelity of her husband3 for Hercules having taken a dislike to Dejanira,
who bore him Hyllus, had fallen in love with Iole, the daughter of Eury-
tus, who refusing to give her to him, he subdued Oechalia, killed the king,
and carried off the princess. On his return from this expedition he sent
Lychas for his vestments, in order to prepare for the sacrifice he intended
to offer. Then Dejanira‚ in resentment of the ill treatment he had given
her, sent him either a Philtre which occasioned his death, 01· a Tunic be-
smeared with the pitch found near Babylon, which when warin sticks close
to the skin3 this latter is, in all probability, what the poets and historians
mean by the Centaur's coat: however, Hercules finding the state of his
body so distempered, that he had no hopes of a recovery, killed Lychas
and threw him into the sea, where, as Ovid relates, he was turned into a
rock. Hercules then went into Trachina, and having forced Dejanira to
put an end to her life, he consulted the Oracle.concerning his disorder, but
could receive no other answer, than that he should go with his friends to·
Mount Oeta, and there raise a funeral pile, which he immediately exe-
cuted,. and soon as it was finished‚ laid himself down on it with the great·

less so to others3 who, though they do not put on the envenomed Tunic,
are yet finally brought by it to a situation not less afflicting.
