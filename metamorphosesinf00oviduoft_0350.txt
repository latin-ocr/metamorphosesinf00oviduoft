the birth of Hercules. Lucina obeys‚ and in tho form osan old woman
places herself at the gate of Alcmena's palace‚ where she increases the
Prinoess's pains‚ and opposes her delivery. 'Galanthis, one of her merids,
seeing the old woman, imagines she might have some ill influence on her
mistress's labour; wherefore, in hopes to make her retire, she declares
that Alcmena is brought to bed. Immediately upon this Lucina departs:

Alcmena's pains abate, and the young hero is born.

The goddess, to

punish Galanthis, transformis her into a Weasel, a creature which brings

forth its young by the mouth.
