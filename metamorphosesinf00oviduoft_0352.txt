ΕΧΡ. FAB. v. Am> vt. The birth of Hercules, the sub‘ect of the present
Pable, contains circumstances which require to'be considlered for the better
understanding them. According to Diodorus Siculus and Apollodorus,-
Amphitryon was the son of Aloeus, the son of Perseus3 and Alcmena his.
wife, was the daughter of Electryon, the son of the same hero Perseus ;
thus they were cousin-germ'ans. When their marriage was near being ac-a‘
conip‘lished, it was delayed'by an unforeseen‘ accident: Electryon‚ king of
Rchenae, who had been taking vengeance of the sons of Taphius, for the
death ofhis children, returned victoriouS, and brought with him' his flocks
which they had driven away. Amphitryon, who went to meet him to con-
gratulate him upon the happy success of that expedition, threw his Club, at,
aucow that straggled from the rest, which unfortunately killed his uncle,-
That death, though involuntary, lost hisn the kingdom of Mycenae, 'which
should have been the dowry of Alcmena. Sthenelus, the brdther of Elec÷
tryon, taking advantageof the public aversion which that action had drawn
upon the prime, drove him‘out of the country vof Argos, and made himself
master of his brother‘s dominions, which he left at his death to his son
Eurystheus, the great persecutor of Hercules. “ Amphitryon, obliged thus
to retire to Thebes, was expiated there by Creon ;'but when he thought to
marry Alcmena, who went along with him to that prince's court, she pub-
licly declared that, not belng satisfied with the revenge which her father
had taken on the Teleboae, ³* she would only consent to be the prize of him
who should declare war against them'. Amphitryon accepted the comminus,
and making an alliance with Creon, Cephalus, and some other princes, went
to ravage the island’s' which his enemies possessed} and'making himself
master of them, gave one to Cephalus, 'cs Ι have 'already remarked in
Cephalus's history. ” ' “

It was during this war that Hercules carne into the world ; and whether
Amphitryon had consummated his marriage before his departure ; whether
he returned to Thebes incognito, or to Tyrintha‚ where it was thought-he
was born, it was publishcd that Jupiter, to deceiVe Alcmena, had taken the
form of her husband, and was the father of the young prince: a fable that
was spread abroad to c‘over'some inti-igue 'ix-hichlcmena hnd‘3 or perhaps

 

 

it was only said'in process of timethat Jupiter, instead of Amphitryon, was s

the father of Alcides, upon account ofthe extraordinary valourof tha't princc.
' The ancient po'ets add,· that Juno kept back 'the birth of Hercules, till the
mother ol' Eurystheus w‘as delivered ; which was the cause of his being subn·
'ject and almost a slave to that king: though others pretend that the matter
was decided by the'Oracle' ‘at Delphi. Howe'verthat be, here is the source
osthe heroisin of Hercules, whom', the king of Mycenae obliged to purge
