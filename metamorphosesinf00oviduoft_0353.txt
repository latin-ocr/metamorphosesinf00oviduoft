Greece of the robbers and wild beasts that infested it. This service he
performed at‘the head of Eurystheus's troops which he commanded, as we >

read in Dionysius of Halicarnassus, Lib. I.

Here is then the explanation

of all those pretended persecutions attributed to the jealousy of duno, but “
which ought to be ascribed to the policy of the court of Mycenae.

Of the great number ofexploits said to be performed by the Grecian
Hercules, sua-named Alcides, we shall principally confine ourselves to the
explanation of those called by eminence, his Twelve Labours,

EXPLICATION OF HERCULES'S LABOURS.

(a) Ala-ides in his youth, killed some ser-
pentS, and to embellish that aetion with the
marvellous, he was said to be then in his cra-
dlc, and that they had been sent by J uno to
devour him. (b) ln the forest of Nemea were
a great number os lions that ravaged the
country; our hero huntod them, and killed
the most furious amongst them, whose skin
he always wore. (c) Several thieves‚ as
M. Naseas repens, kept about the Lake
Stymphale in Arcadia, of whom Hercules
freed the country. The nails and wings,
which the poets gave them. in representing
them as birds. shew their cruelty and agi-
lity. (d) The Mars-hes of Lerna, near ArgOS,
were infested by a great number os serpents,
which increased as fast as they were destroy-
ed; but he Setting tire to the place destroy-
ed them. This was the Hydra of·Lerna, whose
heads grew as fast as they were eut off. (ε)
The forest of Erymanthus was filled with
wild boars, which laid waste the country;
these he destroyed, and brought one with

him t'o‘the court of Eurystheus, which so af- ⁷

frighted’ihe king. that he ran to hide him-
self. (f) The stables of Augeas, king of Elis,
were ‘overloaded with dung, owing to the
great number of oxen that prince kept.
and Hercules being obliged to cleanse them,
turned the course of the river Alpheus, and
caused it to flow through them. (g) Hav-
ing pursued for a whole year au Hind, which
Eurystheus had commanded him to take, it
was said that she had feet⁸of brass (Ιι)
Tne river Achelous having overflowed the
country, he raised banks to it. (2) Theseus be-
ing a prisoner in EpiruS, where ⁴he had been
with Pirithous to carry off the daughter 'of
Aidoneus, was released by Hercules, which
is the fleundation ot' the fable that says he
went down to Hell. (¹.) ln the cavern uf
Taenarus, was a monstrous serpent3 he had
orders to kill it; and this was the Cerberus
chained by our hero. (l) Pelias having
been killed by his daughters, his son Acas-
tus pursued them as far as the court of Ad-
metus, who, refusing to deliver up‘Aleestis,
with whom he was in love, was taken* pri-
soner in an engagement, and delivered by
that genereus princess, who would herself
loe his ransom. Hercules, being then in Thes·

going to put her to death, and returned her
to Admetus: this is the foundation of the
fable which says he recovered her from
Hell, after having vanquished Death, and
bound him in chains. (m) The Amazon„-
were in great reputation in the time of Al·-
cides, and their frequent conquests had ren-
dered them very furmidable to their neigh-
bours. Eurystheus mdered that prince to go
and bring away Hippolita’s girdle ; that is to
say. make war against them, and carry off
their treasure. Hercules embarked on the
Euxine Sea, arrived on the banks of the Ther-
modon, a'nd giving battle to those heroines,
defeated them ; part were killed, and the rest
put to flight; he too'k Hippolita, or Antiope,
prisoner, whom he gave to Theseus, but their
queen Menalippa redeemed herself by giving
up the famous girdle‚ that is to say, by pay-
ing her ransom. (n) It was very probatus,
that in this voyage he killed Diomedes, king
of Thrace, and brought away his mareS, which
it was said he fed with human flesh. (o) In

Α returning by Thessaly, he embarked 'with his

Argonauts; but leaving them afterwards went
to Troy, delivered Hesione from the mon—:ter
that was to have devoured her ; and not re·
ceiving from Laomedon the recompenso which
had been promised him, he killed that prince,
sacked the town. and brought away Hesione.
whom he gave to Telamon, his companion
in that expedition, and assistant in the
work.

These are the Labours of Hercules in
Gmece, in Thrace, and Troas. The poets have
recounted several others in distant countries,
which {have designedly separated. as in all
probability they should not have been attri-
buted to the Grecian Hercules. (p) The fif-'st
is his expedition to encounter Geryon, when
he was so incommodet! by the Suu, that he
>shut his arrows at him. (q) The Sun, admir-
ing his conrage, made him a present of a
golden goblet; in which, as Pherecydes re-
ports, he embarked, and arrii-ing* in Spain,
defeated Geryon, a prin'ce so fairwus for his
three heads; that is, he either reigned over
three islandis, supposed to lse Majorca, Minor-
ca. and Ebusa; or else, Hercules defeated threq
princes, who were in strict allianee. He
thence passed the Straits of Gibraltar to Afri-
ca, wikere he fought With Ama-us, xvh-⁴.) 09st-
