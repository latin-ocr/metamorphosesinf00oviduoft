nxp- FAB, 11. Orpheus, who is the principal subject of this Fable, has
been so eminently distinguished by the heathen mythologistS, as to make it
necessary to be somewhat particular respecting him. In his days poetry and
music were little known in Greece; and as he was eminent for both, they said.
he was the son of Apollo and the muse Calliope: moreover, that he charmed
the beasts of the forest, and that even the trees were notinsensible to the har·-
mony of hislyre3 all which figuratively express the power of his eloquence‚
which he employed for the improvement of mankind, and the harmony of his
verse to soften their mannerS. He was so eminently distinguished as to be called
the Interpreter of the Gods ; and is said from the knowledge he had of the
Egyptian theology‚ to have framed that of the Grecians; and to have been
taught the knowledge of the true God by the Hebrews, while in Egypt.

Queen Eurydice, his wife, dying very young, he was so much affected by
her loss, that he travelled into Thesprotia, where they made incantations to
raise the ghosts of the departed3 and being deceived by a phantom, was so
disturbed on the occasion‚that he renounced the society of mankind, and re-
tircd to the mountains of Thrace: this journey, and his separatiug himself

. from the world, gave rise to the report of his descent into Hell.

There is a strong similitude in this story to the scriptural account of the
wife of Lot, since both husbands lost their wives through the breach of an
express command. Some of the ancients affirm, that Orpheus first esta-
· blished the worship of the gods, especially Bacchus, while others attribute
to him many of the improvements of his age. Upon the whole, he appears
to have been a person of uncommon genius.
