NOTES.

8. Graviore] In a deeper tone, such as is
proper for war.

Plectra] Plectrum is a musicarinstrument,
which the Latius call Pecten. with which the

strings are struck ε so called offov πλήττειν,
i. e. of striking. Gigantas] The battle of
the Giants. See Lib. Ι Ι.

9. Phlegraeis] When the Giants were killed
with thunderboltS. In what part of the earth
this was, writers are not agreed,

10. Leviora} In a sostei· sound, more
adapted to love.

11. Inconcessisque] Unlawful love.

 

and is said to have been carried away by J u-
piter‚ in the form of an eagle, and made his '

cup-bearet.

16. Fulmina] The poet alludes to the con-
stellation Aquila, which, as Statius says of
the eagle, is said to hold a thunderbolt in his
talons. Hence the eagle is called by many
Jovis Armiger, and by Horace, Minister ful-
minis ales.

18. nitidem] Ganymede, the grandson ot*
Ilus.

19. Invitaque] Agaiust the consent of Ju-
no, who took it very ill that her daughter

13. Phrygii] Of the Trojan. For Gany-
mede was the son of Tros, a king ot· Phrygia,

Hebe should be turned out of the cup-beater’s
place, to make way sor Ganymede.

Exp. ΕΑΒ. v. The rape of Ganymede, has its foundation in the following
circumstances in history: Tros, king of Troy, having been successful against
his neighbours, sent his son into Lydia, to offer sacrifices in the Temple of
Jupiter; but this not being known to Tantalus, who had the eagle in his
ensign, he caused Ganymede and his people to be arrested in the Temple,
and thrown into prison, taking them for spieS. The story of his being ap-
pointed Cup-bearer to the Gods, arose *from his being employed in* that ’
station in the court of Lydia. The poets liave' placed him in the Heavens,
where he forms the sign Aquarius. The rape of Ganymede was the occa-
sion of that of Helen by Paris, the great grandson of Tros, who made this
repr-isal on Menelaus, king of Lacedemon‚ the great grandson of the ravisher
of Ganymede. Agamemnon made use of this event to engage the Greeks
and Trojans in the war so fatal to the latter.

FAB. VI. HYACINTHUS INFLOREM.

Apollo playing with Hyacinthus, Boreas turns one of the Quoits out of its.
Course, which strikes the Youth on the head and kills him. From his
Elood springs that Flower which still bears his name.
