ΕΑΒ. 1x. PYGMALIONIS STATUA EBURNEA IN VIRGINEM.

Pygmalion, a famous Statuary‚ provoked by the dissolute Lives of the Pro-
poetides, throws off all Fondness for the Sex, and resolves on a perpetual
Celibacy. But afterwards, falling in Love with a Statue he had made,
Venus, at his request, animates it ; upon which he marries his newly-in-
spired Mistress, and has a Son by her, who afterwards built the City of
Paphos, which bears the name of its Founder.
