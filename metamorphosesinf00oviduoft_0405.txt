exp· ΕΑΒ, xrv. δι xv· As Ovid in his account of the Am'ours of Ve-
nus and Adonis has omitted some circumstances preserved by the ancients,
we shall introduce them here. Mars, jealous of the passion Venus had for
Adonis, implored the assistance of Diana, who to gratify his resentment‚
sent the boar that killed the youth; or, as others relate it, Apollo himself
assumed the form of that Animal : on Adonis‘s descending to the kingdom
of Pluto, Proserpine fell in love with him, and refused to let him return,
notwithstanding the repeated orders of Jupiter3 who, lest he should offend
the goddesses, left the decision ofthis affair to Calliope: and she, in order to
oblige them both, decreed that Adonis should spend one part of his time
with the Queen of Hell, and the other with Venus. The determination of
this affair took up a year, and so offended Venus, that she engaged the wo-
men οξ Thrace to ki'll Orpheus, Calliope's son, as related by Ovid.

Adonis, who was passionabely fond ofhunting‚ when engaged in that ex„
ercise in the forest of Mount Libanus, was wounded in the groin by a wild
Boar3 this accident so much affected Astarte, that she became inconsolable,
and made the city of Byblosecho with her lamentations‚ and all Syria to put
on mourning To render the memor-y of the young prince immortal, feasts
were dedicated to him to be renewed every year : to this practice the ancients
owe most of their gods. Monsieur Banier‚ in his dissertation on the feasts of
Adonis, observes, that the Syrians after having mourne'd several days for the
youth, rejoiced as if he had been raised from the dead; whence it is presurned
his wound did not prove mortal z for his recovery he was indebted to Co·
cutus the physician; this was considered as a prodigy, and celebrated by
the Syrians in a second feast named the Return. This double solemnity
was continued the remainder of his life, and even after his death, and spread
ἥξω Syria and the Isle of Cyprus, into J udea, Asia Minor, and several
ot er countries.

Many of the learned authors supposed that Adonis and Osiris were one;
and that by the afflictior: of Venus was represented that of Isis lamenting
the death of her husband.
