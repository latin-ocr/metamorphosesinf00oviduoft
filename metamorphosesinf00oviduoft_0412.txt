exv. FAB. ιι. Of the gods of the Pagans, there were several classes, and
the rnost inferior were the Satyrs and Silenus; the latter being no other
than Satyrs advanced in years. Silenus, mentioned by Ovid‚ was born
at Malea, inferior to the godS, but' superior to man, not being subject
ω mortality. His figure, short, thick, and fleshy; bald, flat-nosed‚ and
red-visaged; full os those marks that distinguish the drunkard; often
represented sitting on an ass, so intoxicated as to be scarce able to keep
himself from falling, or else reeling and staggering on font, with a Thyr-
sus or Club in his hand to support him. He is most admirably described
by Virgil in his Vlth Eclogue. The ancients agree he was entrusted with
the education of Bacchus; and however disgraceful the description we have
given of Silenus, he had his lucid momentS, and appeared the able philoso,
phei- and great captain. In the Argument, it is related how he came to be sent
ιο Midas, and this gave him an opportunity of discoursing with him re-
specting the unknown world, which Plato and other philosophers have said
so much of. By Plutarch he is said to have discoursed on Death and other
moral subjects. so that he must have been of a most extraordinary compo-
sition. lt is said he was the cotemporary and friend of Midas, who was
