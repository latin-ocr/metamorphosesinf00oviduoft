Pan is so elated with the Praises of some Nymphs who had heard his Pipe,
that he dares to challenge Apollo to play with him. The Mountain God
Tmolus, who is chosen J udge of their performance, decides in favour οἵ
Apollo; and the whole Company approve his J udgment‚ except Midas,
who, for his stupidity in preferring Pan, gets a Pair of Ass's ears: these
he very carefully conceals till his Barber discovers them, who makes
known his deformity in a very singular manner. Apollo and Neptune,-
build the Walls of Troy for Laomedon, who refuses the Gods the Rea-ard
he bad agreed for : Neptune punishes his Perjury by an Inundation of
the Country. Laomedon is obliged to expose his Daughter to a Sea-
Monsten to appense the Gods, who is released by Hercules ; and Lao-
medon defrauds him likewise ofa Set of Horses he had promised him.—
The Hero sack-s Troy in Revenge, carries off Hesione, and gives her in
marriage to his Companion Telamon.
