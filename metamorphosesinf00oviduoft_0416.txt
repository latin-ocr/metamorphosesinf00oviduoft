uxr. rna: ιν. v. & vr. Midas is said to be the son of Gordius and Cy-
bele; to be possessed of great riches, and a perfect economist; so much
so, that whatever he touched is said to have been turned into gold; and to
express his fondness for wine, he is introduced into the company of Bac·
chus, whom it is said he honoured with a particular worship. Others will
have it that Midas was the first that discovered gold in the rivet Pactolus,
and thence the foundation of the Fable. Strabo says he possessed the
mines in Mount Bermius. In his infancy, some ants were observed to put
grains of wheat into his mouth as he lay in his cradle‚ a circumstance por-
tending the riches and frugality of his future day. His approbation of
Pan's abilities, in preference of Apollo's, shews that he was stupidly igno-
rant in other matters, (110 uncommon lot) and highly merited the mark
set upon him.

Laomedon, who reigned in Troy, was the first. prince who undertook
the enclosing that city with a wall, which he executed with such success,
that it was said to be done by Apollo; and the strong banks which he was
under the necessity of raising to keep out the sea, were considered as the
work of Ne tune: on their being ruined by a great tempest‚ it was re·
ported the (rod of the Sea had revenged himselfof Laomedon, for refusing
him the gratuity agreed upon for the undertaking. Herodotus says, he
was permitted to use the treasure of the Temple of Neptune, on a promise
of 1811111111111Γ it when in his power, which he never performed3 and to ap-
pease the God, the oracle declared it was necessary to expose a virgin of
the royal blood to the fury of a monster, which by lot fell upon Hesione,
whose delivery was undertaken by Hercules, on a promise of a set of
horscs, which was not complied with, on which 118 plundered his city,
killed Laomedon, and gare 1115 kingdom tobis son PodarceS‚ who took
the name of priam. Hercules carried off Hesione aud gave her in mar·
riage to his friend Telamon, who had assisted him in the enter-prise. But
laying the marvellous aside, the Fable is easily explained. By the Monster
we are to understand the inundation that broke from the sea, against which
the Trojans were obliged to raise banks3 and Hesione was the offered
reward of him who should best succeed in the work. The six Herses
