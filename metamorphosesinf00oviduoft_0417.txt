supposed the hero would not have engaged in so long and difficult a work

Proteus foretells that Thetis should have a Son who would be more power-ful
than his father, and exceed him in valour. Jupiter, who was in Love with
her, alarmed by this Prediction, yields her to Peleus. The Goddess flies
his Addresses, by turning herself into various Shapes‚ till by the Advice
of Proteus, he holds her fast, marries her, a'nd has Achilles by her. Pe-
leus goes afterwards to Ceyx, king of Trachinia, to expiate the Death of
his Brother Phocus, whom he had killed. Ceyx is in a deep Melancholy,
and relates to him how his Brother Daedalion‚ in the Transports of his
Grief for his Daughter Chione, who had been killed sor vying with Diana,
had been transformed into an Hawk. During this Relatum, Peleus is
informed that a Wolf, Psamatbe had sent to revenge Phocus‘s Dcath, is
making havock of his aHerds. He endeavours to avert the Goddess's
Augen but she is deaf to all his Prayers, till by Thetis's Intercession
she is appeased‚ and turns the Wolf into a Stone.
