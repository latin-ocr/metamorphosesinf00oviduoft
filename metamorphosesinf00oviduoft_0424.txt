EXP. FAB. vu. VI11. & rx. Thetis being exceedingly beautiful, was
greatly admired by Jupiter, but being informed by Proteus, that she would
have a son more powerful than the person who would be his father, thought
it prudent to give up his pretensions to Peleus, whose addresses the prin-
cess endeavoured to elude, by changing herself into'rlifferent forms; but
by the advice of Proteus, Peleus bound her'. having found her sleeping.
That is, Thetis being addressed by several princes, 'had 'no inclinatlon to
submit to the entreaties of Peleus; but by the inter-position rof friends, all
difficulties were removed, and the birth of Achilles was the consequence of
their union. Ia this Fable, Ovid represents Peleus as the assassin' of his
brother Phocus (notwithstanding it has been asserted he was accidentally
killed by a quoit‚ as they were at play) and obliged to retire from court,
to make expiation sor his brother's death in the kingdom of Trachinia, where
Ceyx reigned; here he came acquainted with *the history of Chione, the
daughter of Daedalus, who was the favourite both of Apollo and Mercury,
and is said to have borne each a son, which, perhaps, has no other founda-
tion than the great difference of the disp'ositions of her two sons; for Auto-
lycus was a cunning crafty robber, aud for his thieveries was said ιο be the
son of Mercury; the other, Philammon, a pa'ssioha'te lover of music, there·
fore said to have Apollo for his father: but Chione, ptiding herself in the
dignity of her lovers, dared to prefer herself to Diana, for which *the god-
dess pierced her tongue with an arrow, which occasioned her death. aud
was the cause of her father-'s thr-owing himself from the top of Parnassus,
when he was transformed into a Sparrow-Hawk by Apollo.

Ovid in this Fable says, that while Ceyx is relating to Peleus the occasion
of his distress, the she herd Anetor came to acquaint him, that a Wolf, sent
by the Nerei'd Psamat e, the mother of Phocus, was destroying the country,
and the flock brought by Peleus, in revenge for his entertaining the inurdercr
of his son, which Peleus considering in that light, endeavoured to appease “
her with sacrifices, which were attended with success. The foundation of
this sablois historical. AEacus had two wives, Egina and Psamatbe, hy the
first he had two' sons, Peleus and Telan10n; and by the second. Phocus. Ly-
comedes, the king of Scyros and brother of Psamatbe, resolved to revenge
the death of his nephew‚ whom Peleus had killed3 he'therefor'e declar-ed war
against 'Ceyx sor entertaining Peleus in his dominions. The'captain who had
the command of his troops ravaged the cou'nt‘ry', and carried off the flockc
of Peleus· Prayers and entreatics were made use of to a'ppease Lycomedes,
