Ceyx, going to Claros, to consult the Oracle about his Brother's Death‚ is
shipwrecked in the Voyage. J uno sends Iris to the God of Sleep, who, at.
her desire, dispatches Morpheus to Halcyone in a Dream, to inform her of
the Death of her husband. She awakes in the Morning full of inquie-
tude, goes to the shore, and there sees Ceyx’s Body thrown out of the
Waves. While she in Despair is going to cast herself into the Sea, the
Gods transform them both into King’s-Fishers.
