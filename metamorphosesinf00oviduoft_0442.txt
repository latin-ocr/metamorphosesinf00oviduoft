no sooner killed than their dam suffered the same fate, when instantly the
serpent was turned into a stone. He also acquainted them of the necessity
there was, before they proceeded, to appease the resentment of Diana,
who was offended at Agamemnon's killing an hind in a grove sacred to her,
and that this could not be effected but by sacrificing a princess of the royal
blood. As soon as the king heard of this, he was upon the point of aban-
doning the enterprise ; but was at length prevailed upon to send Ulysses to
Argos for his daughter Iphigenia, whom Diana prevented from being sa·
crificed by accepting of Agamemnon‘s submission; and, leaving an hind
for an oblation, took the princess with her to Tauris.

No sooner was Diana rendered propitious, but a favourable gale brought
the fleet to Troas, where the Phrygians were prepared to receive them,
The Greeks were likewise informed by the Oracle, that he who first went
on shore would most certainly be killed; and Protesilaus, fearing it might
intimidate the army, most generously offered to be himself the vicum, and
to sacrifice himself for the service of his country: accordingly he landed
first and met his fate from the hand of Hector, who thus informed the
Greeks what enemies they had to contend with. CygnuS, one of Hector's
truisi, signalized himself so much upon this occasion, that he was taken
notice of by Achilles, who singled him out as a competitor worthy to en-
counter‚ and on whom to make an essay of that valour which it was his
purpose to display3 wherefore he made briskly up to him, and having cast
several darts without effect, at last closed with him, and taking him in his
arms, pressed him to death, and cast his body from a rock into the sea.
The Greeks who engaged in this war, were employed nine years in reducing
the towns within land and on the coasts, before they advanced to the walls
of the city, ‚which fell in the tenth, when Achilles was killed, whose ar-
mour was contended for by AJax and Ulyssesss but the contest being deter-
mined by the Grecian captains in favour of the latter, the issue affected
Ajax so much, that he put an end to his life, and a flower grew from the
spot which was moistened by his blood. ’
