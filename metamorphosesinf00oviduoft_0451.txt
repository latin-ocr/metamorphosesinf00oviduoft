EXP. ῈΑΒ. 1. 11. ἃν 111. Cygnus, who was killed by Achilles, and whose
body he cast from a rock into the sea, is said to be the son of Neptune,
who to perpetuate his memory, turned him into a Swan; but these two cir-
cumstances arose from the following particulars. First, from Cygnus being
a prince very powerful at sea3 again, from the resemblance his name had
to that bird. ‘

To trace an origin to divine ancestors, was the prevailing folly of these
times3 and to humour this last shift of exhausted flattery‚ the ancients
rarely failed to furnish some story ofa metamorphosis, As to what is ob-
sen-ed respecting the Serpent, and the necessity of sacrificing to the god—
dess Diana, it is supposed they had no other foundation than a desire some
prince had of adding the marvellous to an undertaking that it was expected
would be attended with a variety of difficulties, while others think them the
invention of some one of the commanders, who, not esteeming Agamem-
non, would willingly have ¹declined serving under him; and hoped, by this
prince’s refusal of his daughter for the sacrifice, and the length of time the
siege was to hold, to have prevented him from accepting the command of-
fered him, by which means his own desire would have been accomplished.

The Greeks and Trojans, after the first skirmish, make a truce; and the
Grecian princes, assembled at a feast, express their surprise at Cygnus
being invulnerable. Nestor takes occasion from thence to relate several
remarkable circumstances of the fight between the Centaurs and Lapi-
thites; and among others, how the nymph Caenis, after having yielded
to Neptune’s caresses, had been transformed into a Man, and made in-
vulnerable3 and how the Centaurs, after various unsuccessful attempts
on him, were obliged to press him to death, as Achilles had done Cyg-
nus. Periclymenus, Nestor’s brother, who had received from Neptune
the power of transforming himself, is changed into an Eagle in one of his
