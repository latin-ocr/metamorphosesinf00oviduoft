that ιπτγετς. an horseman and a Thessaliambecame synonymous. The poets
i'eigned thern to be the offspring of Ixion and a cloud, which he embraced
instead of Juuo, but this had its foundation from there being a city called
Nephele, which in Greek signifies a cloud. The Centaurs are mentioned
to have retired to the mountains of Arcadia, for the Lapithites forced them
from their lurking places, pursuing them to the promontory of Melea, where
Neptune took thern under his protection, that is, they put to sea in order
to escape from Hercules, whose resentment they had again drawn on them,
by their ill treatment of his preceptor Chiron z others of them retircd to the
island of the Sirens, where by their voluptuous and debauched lives, they
destroyed themselves 3 aud the carcases of such as were buried cast such a

or stinking. The time of their defeat is said to be the 35th year before the
siege of Troy. , “

Pliny informs υς, that Phidias and Parrhasius lest a most beautiful carmon,
representing this engagement, which was preserved in Athens.

Of these creatures of the imagination, which Ovid supposed thern, Trist.
L. iv. the ancier-‚ts created a different species, to whom they attributed the
greatest accomplishm'ents and knowledge ; for the Centaur Chiron (the son
of Saturn and Philira) had the most honourable appointrnent5‚ as he had the
tuition ofAEsculapius, Apollo, and Hercules; the first he instructedin physic,
the second in music, the third in astronomy‚ and Achilles he taught to ma-
nage the great horse, and to be a master of music ; and at last he was placed
in the heavens, where he forms the sign Sagittarius in the Zodiac.

Periclymenus, who had the art of transforming himself 'into different
shapes, at last assumed that of an Eagle, when he was killed by an arrow
shot by Hercules. From this we are to understand, that he was a brave and
warlike priuce, who, after having long resisted the attacks of his enemies,
was at length killed by an arrow. Neptune is said to have given him this
power; that is, his grandfather, who was a maritime prince, and was called
Neptune, taught him the art ofwar, which he industriously made use of, but
unfortunately for him, it only served to defer his ruin.

The death of Achilles, which our author mentions in the seventh Fablc

of this Book, being a remarkable event in history, we shall take notice ot'

the chief cIrcumstances that attended it. Our hero having seen Polyxena,
the daughter of Priam, with Cassandra, as she was offering sacrifices to A-
pollo, fell in love with her, and demanded her in marriage, to which Hec-
tor would not consent, unless he would betray the Greeks; this proposal.
so injurious to his honour, provoked him so much, that in an engagement
with the Trojans, he made up to Hector, whom he killed, and dragged his
body thrice round the walls of Troy. l‘riam, when hc went to demand thc
body of his son, took with him Polyxena, in hopes her presence would con-
tribute to his success. The aged monarch perceiving that Achilles conti-
nued his affection for his daughter consented to their marriage, which was

to be celebrated in the temple of Apollo. Paris, who concealed himself μ

behind the altar, woundcd him in the heel, (the only partin which he was
vulnerable) while Deiphobus pretended to embrace hini. But to lay aside all
fiction of Α ροΠοέ directing the blow, (as ifit had been necessary that a God
should be employed to take away this hero's life, which a mortal could not,
as mentioned by Sophocles in his tragedy of Philoctetes, ) incidents are intro-
duced to rendcr the manner of his death the more singular. The wound
that Paris gave him cut the tendon of the heel, which wound is mortal un-
less attcudcd hya skilful hand3 andro confirm what has been just related, that.
