of Achilles, however it has been received, was not known to Homer, as that

THE ARGUMENT-

On the death of Achilles, Ajax and Ulysses contend for his armoni-3 the
Greek Captains having adjudged it to the latter, Ajax, in resentment,
kills himself, and his blood is changed into a flower. Ulysses having
brought Philoctetes, who had the keeping of Hercules's arrows, to the

then taken and sacked·; and Heeuba³becomes a slave to Ulysses.
