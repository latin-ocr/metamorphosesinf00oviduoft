NOTES.

Telamon was not innocent of his brother-‘s
death, having wounded him m'th his sword
in the neck; for which they were banished
by ΛΕΜ-υς. L'lysses mentions these in order
to lessen what was objected to him respect-
ing Sisyphus, who was counted among his
ancestors by his mother’s side. And in this
he shows himself to be more noble than Λ-
jax ; as not any marks of infamy appeared
against him on his father-’s side, whereas
the father and uncle of Ajax were both ba·
nished for killing their brother. This,
¹‘ dmnnatus et exul,'' is in return for Ajax's
him, ver. 25.--“ ubi AEoliden saxum grave
Sisyphon urget.”

146. Cyllenius] Mei-cury, so called from
Cyllene, a mountain of Arcadia. The mo-
ther of Ulysses wasthe daughter of Autolycus;
whose father was M ercury.

149. Insons] Innocent‚ guillless.

151. Dummodo, &cd Ajnx was nearly
related to Achilles, on which he founded no
small pretensions to his arms3 of this Ulys-
ses was so sensible, that he begs the eonten-
tion should rather be determines by their
services: alledging‚ that if consanguinit)-
was to have any weight, other candidates
might be found whose protensions were ns
well founded.

155. Illi.] To Achilles.

156. Phthiam] W'here Peleus is.

Scyro-J Wl'here Pyrrhus is. Tne Greeks

’ seut for him afterwards to the war.

157. Temen] This Teucer was brother
to Ajax hy the‘ same father, but not by tho
same mother: Teucer was the son of 'rela-
mon by Hesione ; Ajax by Eriboea.

159. Ergo operum, δια] For the question
is, which of us has best served the Grecian
army hy our exploits ἱ) Ι am not able to re-
count what Ι have done.

162. Praescia venturi, &c.] Ulysses begins
here to relate his particular services without.
the least ostentation.

Genitrix Nereia] Thetis, the daughter of
Nereus, was the mother of Achilles.

165. Dissimulet] Similo or simulo, as, sig-
nifies to make alike t dissimulo, to make un-
like; therefore, the first signifies also, to
suppose a thing to be, that is not τ :ind the
latren- to suppose a thing not to be, that
really is, or hence, to conceal. These sig-
nifications are set forth in our dictionaries ;
but not in the regular order they flow from
the radix. The compilers of such books
have no't suiliciently attended to this, hence
it is, that they give many words seemingly
of contrary significations, at least very dif-
ferent, which might have been avoided by
attending to etymology—s. n. Ι would there-
fore advise tho young scholar cai-efully to
learn the primary signification ofwords, when
the diversity would easily follow, and be more
readily obtained.

Cultu, διε-3 By bis dress3 sor Achilles
was disguised in the habit of a virg-Iu.
