exp, ξΑΒ. 1. 11. δε 111. It is universally agreed, that the two harangues
of which this Fable is composed, are master—pleces in their way. In one
are to be seen all that noise and bluster which are usually practised by a
rude, insolent, and hectoring officer ε in the other are displayed the powers
of an artful, insinuating eloquence. The question managed here by the
poet is, whether of the two should have the preference; which has already
been treated with great solemnity and penetration, by that great orator,
Cicero. Ovid, in the ingenious mannerhe has managed it, and in making
the decision, is inimitable: pointing the contenders in the most lively co·
lours, and supporting the contrast between the characters with the utmost
propriety. ¹

Ajax was so much enraged, we are told, at the Greeks' determination in
favour of his rival, that he became distracted ; and in his madness, fell upon
some flocks of sheep, as if they had been the enemy, and in the end, stabbed
himself with the sword given him by Hector, for which, in return, Ajax
had presented him a belt, being marks of acknowledged valour‚ on their
parting, after engaging each other for a day. Homer was of opinion, that
this was the real occasion of his fate 3 as he says, Ulysscs declared, that when
»in hell, the shades ofall the Grecian heroes cameto meet him, except that of
Ajax, who still resented the contention he had with him for Achilles' armour.

Hismetamorphosis into theHyacinth, is no other than a romantio episode,
nor can we be certain what flower it is. Discorides believes it to be the
vaccinium, which bears a purple flower, on which are supposed to be seen

the two letters mentioned by Ovid. Ajax was buried near the promontory
Sigeum, where a tomb was erected to his memory.
