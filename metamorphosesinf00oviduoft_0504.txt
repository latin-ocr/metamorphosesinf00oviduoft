exp> FAB. vn. vm. xx. ἃ· x. What is said in this Fable of the daugh-
ters of Anius having the power of ,transforming every thing they touched,
into wine, corn, and oil, has its foundation in their great parsimony‚ by
which they amassed large quantities of each. But Bochart says it arose
from their being called Oeno² Spermo, and Elai, which in the old Phoeni-
cian language signifled wine, corn, and oil. The remarkable example of
public spirit shewn by the daughters of Orion, spirited the Thebans to
emerge from the luxury they had fallen into. and to become as famous for
their bravery, as they had been noted for effeminacy ; which occasioned it
to be said, that the ashes of the princesses had been transformed into men.

The contention that Apollo, Diana, and Hercules were enga ed in, re-

·‘specting the city of Ambracia, now called Larta, was agreed o be left to'

the determination of Cregaleus‚ who gave it in favour of Hercules, which
offended Apollo so much, that he transfor-med him into a rock, which
stood near the city. The interpretation that is given of this fable is, that
the people of Ambracia dedicated their city to Hercules, in preference to
the other deities; that is, they were fondcr ofwarlike exploits than of cul-
tivating the arts and scIences ; and the transformation of Cregaleus into a
rock by Apollo, meant to point out his stupidity in making so absurd a
choico. ’ ’ ·

By the escape of Alcander, Megaletor, and Philaeus, the three sons of
Molossus, and his daughter Hyperipe, from sire, by the wiugs given thern
by the gods, we are to understand, that their father's palace being set on
firc by some robbers, they cscapcd the flames in an extraordinary manner.

We shall introduce here some account of the Dodonaean maele, which
seems to be involved in great obscurity: Silius Italicus says, that the ssight
of two pigeons, from Thebes to Egypt and Lybia‚ gave risc to the remark-
able oracle ofJupiter Ammom and that one perching upon an oak in
Chaonia, occasioned thc crecting os an oracle there. Herodotus says,
they were two priestesses of the Egyptian Thebes, who were carried off by
some Phoenician merchants, one of whom settled in the forest Dodona,
where she gave responses from her chapel. They called her the Dove, as
being a foreigner, and not untlcrstanding their language; but in time com-
ing to speak it, they said the Dovc spoke. These ¹oracles have been said
to be conveyed by brass kettlcs‚ called thc Cauldrons of Dodona; in'the
forest stood two pillars at a small distance from each other; on one was
placed a brazen vessch and on the other'a figure of a little boy (as may be·
supposed) of cloch-work, who held a brazen whip, from which hung several
lashes; these, when moved by the wind, struck the vessel, and occasioned
a ringing, by which, they said, the will of the gods was conveyed. This
gave rise to the proverbial saying amongst the Greeks, of a Dodonaea»
liettle, for aprating, talkative fello-se. ’
