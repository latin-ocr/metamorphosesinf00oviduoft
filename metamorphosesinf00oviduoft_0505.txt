NOTES.

1. Proxima] The poet describes AEneas's
voyage, by which he at last came into Sicily,
where the youth Acis was turned into a river
of his own name. The Phaeaces are a people
of the island Corcyra, famous for the orchards
of Alcinous.

2. Ab his] After this, in tliev next place.

Regnataque vati Phrygia] Helenus, the
son of Priamus, to whose lot (after the death
of Pyrrhus, who was slain by Orestes) An-

dmmache, the wife of Hector, (taken by Pyr-
rhus, and married to him in Epirus) fell,
wit-h the kingdom of Epirus.

3. Buthrotos] Α. city. not far distant from
Corcyra.

simulataque Troja] Helenus had in Epi-
rus built a city in the form of ancient Troy.

6. Sicaniam] Sicily.

’7. Obversa.] Is turned.

Ad Austros.] Towards the south.

ὃ. Mollibus. 5 Gensse, mild.

Lilybaeon.] Is a city and promontory of
Sicily, looking towards the west, from whence
Zephyr blows.

Arcton] To the north.

9. Peloros.] Peloros was so called of Pe-
Uotis‚the admiral of Hannibal‘s ηδ’-Ὺ, who

x

was buried there.

11. Zanclaea] Zancle is a city of Sicssffi
so called either after Zanclus the giam, or
the fountain Zancle.

152. Scylla] There were two Scylla's ;
one the daughter of Nisus, who was turned
into a bird, and the other the daughter of
Phocus that was turned into a sea-monster.
which is here spoken of, and which is said ω
swallow those ships that sail in the Siciliain
sea. The sable took its rise from a very dan-
gerous rock in the mamertine bay, between
Italy and Sicily. . ' -

Charybdis] The poets supposed this per-
son to have been a very thievish old woman.
who having stolen J upiter's osen, was thrown
by him into the sea, and turned into a sea-
monster‚ which retains its former rapacium
natur23 for it draws to it the ships which
pass that way, swallowing them and throwing
them up again. This is a very dangerous
whirlpool in the Siciliam sea, over against
Scylla.

14. lna.] Scylla, whose womb was en-
compassed with fier-ce dogs, see Book xiv·
Fab. 1. ’
