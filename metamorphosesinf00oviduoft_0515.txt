THE ARGUMENT.

Circe becomes enamoured of Glaucus, who complains to her of Scylla's in-
difference. She endeavours to make him leave his ungrateful Mistress
for her ; but without success In revenge she poisons the fountain where
that Nymph used to bathe, and thereby makes her Form hideous‚ which
is so insupportable, that. she throws herself into the Sea, and is trans-
formed into a Rock.
