exi». ΕΑΒ, ι. Circe from her knowledge in simples‚ was called the
Daughter of the Sun; and from the ill use she made of it, by compounding
poisons, she was called a Sorceress. The enchantments which were attri-
buted to her were the effect of her beauty, which drew after her a number
of suitors, who indulging themselves in the corrupt manners of her court,
were said to be lost. Glaucus, being greatly enraged at the ‹lisdain his
mistress Scylla treated him with, applied to Circe for a composition ; with
this they poisoned the sountain where the nymph usually bathed which
