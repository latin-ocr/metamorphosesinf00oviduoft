Exr. rAn. 111. The Sibyls, and the books attributed to them, have much
engaged the attention of the best historians. They are said to contain many
of the mysteries of christianity, which can be no other than the pious fraud
of some zealot3 as it is not to be supposed that heathenish women should
speak in more clear and positive terms ‘respecting our Saviour, and his doc-
trines, than did Moses or any of the prophets. It is not to be doubted, but
in the early ages there were women who were consulted, and who by ob-
scure sentences», afforded food for the imagination of those who were warm
in any undertaking, and these they interpreted agreeable to the bcnt of their
inclination ; they were prophetesses, and called the priestesses of Dodona
and Del hi. ’

The alecount that the ancient historians gave of the introduction of the
Sibylline books, has in it something so remarkable, that we cannot omit it:
Itis said that an old woman came to Rome, and presented to Tarquin the
proud, nine books, that contained the oracles of the Sibyls, demanding conss
siderable sums for them, which the king refused ; on this she departed, and
having burned three of them, returned, and demanded the same sum for
what then remained3 which being refused, she burned three more, aud again
returned, not abating in the least from what she first demanded, which did
not a little surprise Tarquin, and so raised his curiosity, that he purchased
them.

The Sibyllino verses, which they consulted at Rome, inculcated nothing
but idolatry, and inhuman sacrificem whereas those we have now, teach
the worship of the true God, and the Incarnation of Jesus Christ, as related
in the sacred writings. ' ‘ ’ ”
