exe. ΕΑΒ. Χ, XI. & xn. 'Phe transformation of AEneas's fleet into Sea-
Nymphs means nothing more than their being saved by a strong wind frorn'
being burnt by Turnus ; and the story of the bird Ardea arising from the
ashes of the city of Turnus, fired by AEneas, was occasioned by the resort
of Herons to its ruins. AEneas, who had been remarkable for his adven-
tures, fell at last in battle, and to perpetuate his memory they ranked him
amongst the deities under the name of Jupiter IndigeS. For every thing
however unimportant was dressed up in the supernatural. Such was the
cast of these times, when divinities on earth, in the sea, in rivers, and in
woods, nay even in heaven and hell were at human command.

ΕΑΒ. xnl. VERTUMNUS IN ANUM.

Vertumnus, enamoured of Pomona, assumes several shapes to makes him-

self agreeable; and at last gains her, after having turned himself into an
old woman.
