exp· FAB. mv. xv. ὃς xvr. What is related of Anaxarete being turn-
ed into a rock for her insensibility‚ is to be considered as nothing more
than a poetical licence to ornament the relation, like some ofour poets‚ who
transform the eyes of their Phyllises into stars. The remainder of these Fames,
being confined to historical transactions‚ require not any explanation. But
before we quit the subject, we shall observe the distinction that separates the
Historian from the Poet. The first is to relate facts with a strict' attention
to truth ; this confines the writer te a narrative of them as they arise, and.
'to a language that will best express them ς while the Poet gives a loose to
his imagination, and of course abounds more in fiction' than in fact. Ovid‚
{n these Fables, relates some circumstances well known in the Roman his-
tory, with a grandeur well suited to the sublimity of his genius. Thus,
when he mentions the entry of the Sabines into Rome, he brings down the
Queen of Heaven to open the gates for them ; and when he says they en-
gaged the Romans near the Temple ofJanus, he makes the Nymphs of the
Ibunt-ains, at the request of Venus, pour forth rivers of flame, to force them
to retire. With the same licence has he proceeded, embellishing his ac-
count of facts, and indulging a genius and fancy which are inimitable and
peculiar to himself. ·
