ΤΗΕ ARGUMENT. ¹

MysceloS, son· of Alemon, is warned by Hercules in a dream, to leave Ar»
g08‚ and settle in Italy. He is prevented‚ when deparfflng, by a law
which forbids the Argians to leave the City without the Magistrate’s per-
mission: He is tried, and by a miracle absolved3 He retires into Italy,
and builds the City of Crotona. ‘Pythagoras comes there and teaches.
His reputation draws Numa Pompilius to him. The Poet takes this
occasion to speak of his philosophy. Egeria, Numa’s wife, is inconsol-
able on account of his death, and is at last changed into a fountain.
Hippolytus's lim-ses are scared by a Sea-Bull ; and he is killed by a fall

, from his chariot. Tages the diviner, arises out ofa tuft of grass. Ro-
mulus's Lance is changed into a Tree. Cippus goes into voluntary
banis-liment, rather than his country should lose its liberty, by his bes

coming King of it.
