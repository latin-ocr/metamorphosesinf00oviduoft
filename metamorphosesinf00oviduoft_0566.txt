NOTES.

1365. Tabuerint.] Becdme corrupted.

564. Obrue. dcci] Cover slain oxen with
earth z For from them, as virgil writes in
his thh Georg. Bees are produced.

565. Usu.] By experience.

De putri viscere] From corrupted flesh.

567. Rura colunt] Inhabit the fields. For
they are employed in gutlaci-ing dew from
tionem—In spem .] In hopes of enjoying the
future honey of the new hive.

569. Our Poet has here, and in some pre-
ceding Fables introduced the second part of
the Pytthrean philosophy, which endea-
vours to account for those surprizing phaeno-
mena and revolutions that happen in the
course of nature—Some indeed, are true;
many of them a're founded on mistakes or
salse representations, though agreeable to the
philosophy of that time ; but most of them
are the invention of fancy, and the offspring
of poetic fiction. Of this latter sort is the
suble of the river 'Hirace turning men into
birds; of fountains kindling wood, and chang-
ing the colour of hair; and the ridiculous

transformation of the women of Scythia by

poison. ’ of bees springing from the bruised
bowels of calves; of serpents arising from
human marrow; and of the Phoenix being
produced from her own ashes.

573. Tineae.] Butterflies appear in athree-
fuld form, before they arrive at their full per-
feetion : When the spring is approaching. a
little worm is produced from the egg, which
is called Eruea (a multer-worm), this sticks
in the leaves os trees or herm, nnd feeds upon
them ; one species of these is called silk—worins.
and these feed only on the leaves of the mul-
berry-tree. These caterpillars afterwards
turn into Aurelius or Chry-sandes being co-
vered with a skin of a golden colour, until
they have got wings, feet, and other mem-
bers of a just proportion; after which this
covering or skin breaks, and out comes a
wingecl caterpillar‚ fit for generation. For as
long as it continues under the form of a can-
ker-worm‚ or ot' an Aurelia, it is imperfect,
as a Foetus is in the womb of animula—Ob-
'sen-ata] 'Phat has been observed‚ taken notice

οῇδῖιι . Ἑοιῑιῑί.] venomous.
