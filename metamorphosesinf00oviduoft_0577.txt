animal food, the better perhaps to govern and humanize his pupils, who in
those early ages, were not less brutal than ignorant ; and in order to engage
them in this abstinence, he taught the doctrine ofTransmigration, (the spirit
of one body taking possession ofanother ς) inculcating by this a notion that
a man might chance to eat a portion osa former friend. This part of the Py-
thagorean doctrine, Ovid has displayed with all the beauty of wit and inven-
tion he was master of· Some have supported the doctrine just mentioned
according to the litera] acceptation of the words, while others take them in
a' more unconfined sense. As for instance, when it is said that the spirit of
a man had entered the body of a beast, they supposed it no other than a
lively figure, to shew how much his irregular passions had ‹legraded him.

Pythagoras had instructed his pupils in th'e motions of the heavenly bo.
dies, also in the changes of the universe, and other things which are taken
notice of by Ovid, some ofwhich are extravagantly absurd, viz: that the
waters of a river of Thrace petrified all those that drank them; that he knew
ofa fountain which kindled wood ; and that the Phoenix renewed her exist-
ence from the ashes ofher dis-solution.

The Poet, on finishing his eulogium of Numa, introduces the nymph
Egeria, whom Numaxis supposed to have consulted in the Arician forest,
respecting the laws he intended for the Roman government, the better to
give them weight and influence. The same course is said to have been fol.
lowed by Zamolxis, who consulted his Genii in respect to the laws he gave
to the Scythians. As Minos the First consulted Jupiter with regard to the Cre-
tan laws; and Lycurgus, the remarkable legislator, attributed his to A pollo,
All which rnay be well supposed to havehad theirfoundationinwhattheHoly
Scriptures relate of Moses receiving the tables of the law from Mount Sinai,

By what has been said of Numa, we are to understand that he passed his
whole reign in profound peace ; and made it his principal care to encourage
piety and justice, and to civilize his people by good and wholesome laws.
His great wisdom in governing made it believed that he was inspired, which
is the foundation ofthe fable respecting him.

The story of Hippoiytus, as it is related by ovid, is extremely moving‚
and hadits foundation in that distress of mind he was thrown into, which en-
gaged his attention so much, thathe neglected the managementof his horses,
and was unhappily overturned in his chariot, which occasioned his death,
However, the Troezenians, who paid divine honours to this young Prince,
would not give credit to what has just been related; but persuaded them.

and placed him among the Constellations‚ where he appears the Charioteer.

Tages was the first who taught the art of divination; he was deeply skilled
in, auguries and auspices; but being of an obscure origin, was said to have
sprung from the earth. ”

What Ovid has related respecting the spear said to be cast by Romulus
towards the Capitol, from the Aventine Mount, and its becoming a tree,
which flourished until the commencement ofthe first civil war, can only be
considered as an allegory greatly illustrating the sense in which it is to be
taken: the tree represents the Roman constitution‚rwhich flourished, and
with its spreading branches gave protection, so long as it was carefnlly pre-
served and attended to by shose to whom the care of it was particularlyin.

vary its cultivation, than ft began to decline, and that mode of management
adopted by Julius Caesav, was so unnatural as to cause its speedy dissolu-
