NOTES.

156. Praesagia vatum] The divinations of Poets.

mv. ΓΑΒ. x. ovid, in the conclusion of his metamorphoses‚ fulfils that
part of his intention of closing it with the transactions‘ of his own days;
(having in the beginning set out with the creaticn οἱ the world) and in a
period not a little remarkable; as in it happened the death of Julius Caesar,
and his deification, which was a matter now first introduced by Augustus,
who used his influence to have his predecessor enrolled among the Gods,
in hopes the same compliment would be paid to himself when he should
die: which our author in an address seems to flatter him with, but not
until a happy length of days should close the period of his lil'e3 such was
the tribute paid by our poet to the rising sun. But this honour was not
so long dekzyed, as an altar was raised to him, and he numbered amongst the
Gods, when but twenty-eight years of age. The fondness the Romans had
for tracing their ‹lese-ent from AEneas, made them embrace every' opportu-
nity that had the appearance of givings it credit; so that Augustus, to en-
gage them in lus design of deifying Caesar, persuaded them that Venus in-
terested herselfin it; tnis they could not resist‚ as it did honour to one of the
descendants of AEneaS‚ and so much flattered their ridiculous vanity. The
appearance of a Comet at this time occasioned it to be said that the God-
dess had ‚stationed the spirit of Caesar in the Heavens; and the sun also
appearing somewhat obscured by a spot in his disk, they took this occasion
to sav that Apollo wept for their loss. This custom ,ofranking mortals a·
mongst the Gods became so prostituted, that they elevated to that honour
Tiberius the most cruel of the Emperors, as well as Claudius the most
stupid, Cicero mentions that the memory of Caesar became so hateful to
the. people‚ that they pulled down the pillar erected to his memory, when
Dolabella made expiation on the place where it stood, and in his first
Philippic takes notice, that he would ever be against the introduction
of ceremonies, which affected to raise the dead to the state of the immortal

Goda
